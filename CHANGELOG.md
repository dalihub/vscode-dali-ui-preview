# Changelog

All notable changes to the **DALi UI Preview** extension will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Runtime image registry now auto-detects: BART GHCR proxy inside Samsung, else GHCR.**
  Inside the corporate network, direct GHCR pulls intermittently drop (shared egress IP
  throttled by GitHub mid-transfer, fatal for the ~290 MB image). The extension now pulls the
  runtime image from BART's anonymous GHCR caching proxy
  (`ghcr-docker-remote.bart.sec.samsung.net/lwc0917/dali-preview-runtime`) when the proxy host
  is reachable, and falls back to `ghcr.io/lwc0917/dali-preview-runtime` otherwise — the repo
  path is identical, so tags and digests match and update checks are unchanged. Detection runs
  once at activation (cached in globalState with a 24h TTL; a probe of the proxy `/v2/`
  endpoint). `daliPreview.dockerImage` now defaults to **empty = auto-detect**; set it to a
  concrete image to pin a registry. The download progress notification and output channel now
  show **which server** the image is being pulled from.

### Fixed

- **`DEFAULT_DOCKER_IMAGE` fallback pointed at the never-published `ghcr.io/dalihub/...`;**
  corrected to the live `ghcr.io/lwc0917/dali-preview-runtime`.

- **Docker install/repair no longer aborts with `setfacl: Option -m: Invalid argument
  near character 3` for domain/LDAP logins.** The no-reboot flow grants the running VS Code
  session docker-socket access with `setfacl`, and it resolved the username through the local
  passwd database (`u:$USER:rw`). On machines where the login is a networked (LDAP/AD) account
  absent from `/etc/passwd` — common on corporate setups — `getpwnam()` fails, so `setfacl`
  errors out and (via the `&&` chain) takes the rest of the install with it. The ACL is now
  granted by **numeric UID** (`u:$(id -u):rw`), which needs no name lookup and works for every
  account type; `usermod` uses the resolved login name (`$(id -un)`); and both the `setfacl`
  and `usermod` steps are now **non-fatal**, so a non-local account still reaches the ACL grant
  that unblocks the current session. Applies to the install flow, the "Fix for this session"
  repair, the printed manual instructions, and the walkthrough. Guarded by new assertions in
  `installDocker.test.ts` and `dockerAccessCheck.test.ts`. (`installDocker.ts`,
  `dockerAccessCheck.ts`, `media/walkthrough/03-install-docker.md`)

## [0.52.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- **Extension self-update notifications.** Because DALi Preview ships as a `.vsix` (not the
  Marketplace), VS Code never auto-updates it — so colleagues who installed via the one-line
  `install.sh` had no signal when a new release landed. The extension now checks GitHub for a
  newer release **once a day** and, when one exists, offers **Update now** — which re-runs the
  installer in an integrated terminal (you press Enter; nothing installs silently). A manual
  **DALi Preview: Check for Extension Updates** command always reports (including "up to date"),
  and `daliPreview.extensionUpdatePolicy` (`notify` default / `off`) governs the auto-check.
  The version probe goes through `github.com` (not the rate-limited API), so it needs no token
  and works behind a shared proxy. The check runs outside the activation spine and is fully
  fail-silent — a network hiccup can never affect activation or previews. Guarded by
  `extensionUpdateChecker.test.ts` (20 unit tests).

### Fixed

- **The one-line installer (`install.sh`) no longer fails with `HTTP 403` behind a
  shared corporate proxy or VPN.** It previously queried the GitHub REST API
  (`api.github.com/repos/…/releases/latest`), which is rate-limited to **60 requests/hour
  per IP**. When many people egress through one corporate NAT/proxy IP that quota is
  exhausted collectively, so every user gets `403 API rate limit exceeded` — regardless of
  whether they are logged into GitHub, because the request is anonymous. `download_vsix()`
  now resolves the latest release entirely through `github.com`: it follows the
  `releases/latest` redirect to read the tag, then parses the
  `releases/expanded_assets/<tag>` fragment for the `.vsix` download URL. Neither endpoint
  is subject to the API rate limit, so the installer needs no token and no login.
  (`install.sh`)
- **The installer no longer aborts after the extension is already installed.** Run via
  `curl … | bash`, the script's stdin is the pipe, so the trailing
  `sudo apt install xvfb ccache` step could not read a password and — under
  `set -euo pipefail` — aborted the whole run with exit 1 *after* the extension had
  installed successfully, making a working install look like a failure. (`install.sh`)
- Network calls in `download_vsix()` now retry up to 3× to ride out transient GitHub `5xx`
  / proxy blips instead of failing the install on the first hiccup. (`install.sh`)

### Removed

- **The unrelated `nicejackg/generativeUI` fallback repository.** It was a leftover from
  before the extension moved to `dalihub/vscode-dali-ui-preview`; it no longer resolves and
  only surfaced as a confusing log line whenever the primary repo had a transient blip.
  (`install.sh`)
- **Automatic `apt install` of `xvfb`/`ccache` from `install.sh`.** The default Docker
  runtime renders inside the container and needs neither on the host, and the native
  runtime's dependencies are offered by the extension's own guided setup. The installer now
  only installs the extension and never touches system packages — so it no longer needs
  `sudo` at all. (`install.sh`)

## [0.51.1] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed

- **"Use Local DALi Runtime" no longer silently fails when a Workspace/Folder setting
  overrides it.** The command wrote `daliPreview.runtimeMode` to User (Global) scope, which
  VS Code precedence lets a Workspace- or Folder-scoped setting shadow (e.g. previewing a
  file under `test/samples/`, whose `.vscode/settings.json` pins `runtimeMode: "docker"`).
  The switch appeared to do nothing and the panel title kept reading `Docker (…)`. The
  command now detects the shadowing scope, warns which settings file is winning, and offers
  to open it — instead of offering a reload that can't take effect.

## [0.51.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- **Preview panel title now shows the active runtime.** The preview tab is labelled
  `DALi Preview — Local` or `DALi Preview — Docker (<version>)` so you can tell at a glance
  which runtime is rendering after switching via `DALi Preview: Select Runtime Version`
  (previously the tab always read `DALi Preview`, indistinguishable between local and
  Docker). Guarded by a unit test (`runtimePanelTitle.test.ts`).

### Fixed

- **Samples now render at the TV FHD size regardless of a global size override.** `Open
  Examples` opens the tour in a *new window*, and the `examples/` folder shipped **no**
  workspace `.vscode/settings.json` — so with a smaller global `daliPreview.previewWidth/Height`
  set (e.g. a 600×400 fast-iteration override), every sample rendered at that smaller size
  instead of the 1920×1080 the TV samples are laid out for. The tour now ships a workspace
  `settings.json` pinning `1920`×`1080`, so it renders at TV FHD for everyone. Guarded by a
  unit test (`exampleTourSettings.test.ts`) and confirmed to ship in the VSIX (`vsce ls`).

## [0.50.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- **Bootstrap Docker from `DALi Preview: Select Runtime Version` in local mode.** When
  you're on the local runtime and Docker isn't installed/usable, the command no longer
  dead-ends with a "docker is not accessible" warning — it lets you pick a version from
  the registry, installs/fixes Docker, downloads that image, and switches to the Docker
  runtime (persisting the switch only on success; a cancel/failure leaves you on local).

### Changed

- **README (EN/KO) refresh.** Added a Contents / 목차 navigation block, synced the Korean
  README's "real-world code" feature section with the English one, and removed stale
  "new in 0.44" version markers.

## [0.49.0] - 2026-07-01

Release-prep ahead of the Marketplace launch (planned for October): two AI-agent helpers,
legal/manifest hygiene, and activation hardening. **No change to the preview/render output.**

### Added

- **AI agent guide — `DALi Preview: Add AI Agent Guide`.** Scaffolds a merge-safe
  `AGENTS.md` into the workspace so an AI coding agent (Copilot / Cursor / Claude) writes
  *previewable* DALi UI: the file conventions (`*.preview.dali.cpp`, `@dali-preview`
  markers), the non-fluent dali-ui API, and how to self-verify headlessly via the companion
  CLI. Only the DALi block is managed; existing `AGENTS.md` content is preserved.
- **One-click issue reporting — `DALi Preview: Report Issue`.** Opens a GitHub issue
  pre-filled with a bug template **and** auto-collected environment (extension / VS Code / OS
  versions, runtime mode, runtime image). `bugs`/`homepage` are declared so VS Code's native
  "Report Issue" routes there too, and a `.github` bug-report template structures direct reports.
  A genuine internal error also surfaces a one-click **Report Issue** toast carrying the failure.
- **`LICENSE` file (Apache-2.0)** and a `"license": "Apache-2.0"` manifest field. The
  project declared Apache-2.0 in its docs but shipped no license file — required by
  `vsce` and the Marketplace.
- **Examples tour (`Open Examples`) now covers every feature.** Added an **images**
  example (`ImageView` + a bundled asset) and a **live-animation** example (the playback
  scrubber, previously only described), first-run notes on click-to-code / the Widget
  Inspector / inline error mapping, the explicit non-fluent dali-ui rule, and a "Beyond the
  files" index section listing the always-on features — a complete first-run learning path.

### Fixed

- **Images now render on the fast (parser/server) path.** A flat, static preview with an
  `ImageView` takes the warm-server `RENDER_JSON` path and came up **blank** — two bugs:
  1. **The parser fed the server the raw URL.** `stageImageAssets` rewrites a relative
     `ImageView("assets/x.jpg")` to a resolvable path, but the parser strategy parsed the
     un-staged `extraction.code`, so the scene carried the relative URL the server (a separate
     process) can't find. The parser now parses the **staged** code.
  2. **The capture didn't wait for the image.** The server's capture fast path grabbed the
     frame before the async image queued; it now polls for the resource when the scene has an
     `ImageView` (image-less previews keep the immediate fast path).
  3. **The docker server never mounted `/work`.** In docker mode `stageImageAssets` rewrites a
     staged image URL to `/work/<name>`, but the resident preview server only mounted
     `tmpDir:tmpDir`, so the container had no `/work` and the image fell back to the
     broken-image placeholder. The server container now also mounts `tmpDir:/work`.
  Guarded by unit tests (parser gets the staged URL; the docker spawn command includes the
  `/work` mount) + the `image-loads` server golden; verified end-to-end in docker mode (the
  banner sample renders the gradient, not a blank box).
  *(Docker mode also needs the runtime image to carry bug #2's server fix — pull the refreshed
  `:latest` / `:dali_2.5.26`. That refreshed image also **restores the CJK fonts** a prior
  `dali_2.5.26` rebuild had dropped, so Korean/CJK renders again instead of tofu (□). Local
  mode recompiles the resident server on **Restart DALi Runtime**. Bugs #1 and #3 are pure
  extension fixes.)*
- **Samples: the animation sample is now discoverable** — example `04` is renamed
  **`04-focus-and-animation`** (it carries `pulse.preview.dali.cpp`, a real `Animation` + `.Play()`
  with the live scrubber), so it's visible in the folder list rather than hidden under "state".
- **README settings defaults corrected.** `previewWidth` / `previewHeight` were documented
  as `1024` / `600` but the product ships `1920` / `1080` (the TV FHD profile since 0.45.0).
  Also documented the previously-undocumented `daliPreview.background` setting.

### Changed

- **Activation hardening.** `activate()` now wraps its setup in a try/catch that writes an
  actionable breadcrumb to the **DALi Preview** output channel before failing, instead of
  surfacing only VS Code's generic "extension activation failed".
- **Live-preview hardening.** The queued-rebuild path no longer leaves a fire-and-forget
  `runPreview` promise unhandled; a rejection is caught and logged.
- **Manifest polish.** Added `bugs`, `homepage`, and `galleryBanner` for the listing.
- **Renamed `Open Examples` → `Open Samples`** (command title, walkthrough, docs); the
  copied tour folder is now `dali-samples/`. Tour auto-detection is now structural (index
  README + numbered step folders) so renumbering the tour no longer breaks the auto-opened guide.

### Tests / chore

- Added a unit suite for `localRuntimeCommand` (the docker↔local runtime switch wired into
  activation — previously untested). **720 unit tests pass; e2e server-golden 8/8.**
- `.gitignore` now covers the runtime-generated golden diff dirs (`test/e2e/server-diff/`,
  `test/e2e/diff-multifile/`), the nested `dali-ui-preview-cli/`, and dev-time scratch.

## [0.48.0] - 2026-06-29

Beta release for colleague testing — focused on **easy onboarding**.

### Docs

- **README (EN + KO) reworked for first-time setup.** Removed features that no longer
  exist (VNC interactive mode, SDB device preview, GIF capture), added an up-front
  **"which runtime do I need?"** decision table that cleanly splits the two cases —
  🐳 **Docker** (app developers: download a prebuilt container) vs ⭐ **Local** (DALi
  framework developers: render against your own build) — and corrected the `animation`
  directive (it's a scrubber, not a GIF export).

### Added

- **Stale-runtime self-diagnosis** (`errorParser.detectRuntimeApiSkew` +
  `RUNTIME_API_SKEW_HINT`). When a preview fails to compile because the runtime is
  older than the code (dali-ui child-API skew — e.g. `'class Dali::Ui::FlexLayout'
  has no member named 'AddChildren'; did you mean 'Children'?`), the error panel now
  appends an actionable, **mode-aware** hint: docker runtime → pull a fresh image;
  local runtime → the native DALi prefix predates the code (rebuild it, or switch to
  docker). This is a runtime problem, not a code bug. Wired into both `diagnoseGccErrors`
  and `formatRawError`; 6 `errorParser.test.ts` cases.
- **`npm run verify:previews` / `verify:previews:docker`** (`test/e2e/previewCompileSweep.js`)
  — compiles **every** `*.preview.dali.cpp` (examples/ + test/samples/) against the
  native prefix or the docker image and prints a pass/fail matrix flagging API skew.
  The golden runners only cover `test/samples/` in docker, which let a stale **native**
  prefix (runtimeMode=local) ship the AddChildren error unverified; this closes that gap.

### Fixed

- **Skew detector now matches real g++ output.** g++ quotes identifiers with Unicode
  curly quotes (U+2018/U+2019), not ASCII — the initial detector regex only matched
  ASCII `'…'`, so it silently never fired on actual compiler output (and the ASCII-quoted
  unit tests masked it). The regex (and the sweep) now accept both; tests use real
  curly-quote fixtures.

### Notes

- The `parser` fast path was **kept** (not removed): it renders a JSON scene the
  in-runtime server translates to dali-ui, so it is insulated from method renames and
  was unaffected by the `Children → AddChildren` change (verified: 8/8 server-path
  e2e green). Only the g++ **compile** paths surface a stale-runtime skew.

## [0.47.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- **Parser fast path restored for current dali-ui code.** The `parser` strategy
  (cppParser → resident server `renderJson`, **no g++ compile**, ~80–200 ms) had
  gone dormant after the fluent chaining API was removed (2026-06): `cppParser`
  only understood a single `Type::New().Method()...` expression, so every
  imperative-style preview (`FlexLayout root = …; root.SetX(…); root.AddChildren({…});
  return root;`) failed to parse and silently fell back to the slower compile path.
  `cppParser` now also parses the imperative builder form — variable declarations
  (incl. `auto`) into a symbol table, `var.Setter(...)` mutations, and `AddChildren`
  children resolved by name — producing the same `SceneNode` tree the C++ server
  already renders (no server change). Click-to-code source-line tagging is preserved.
  Self-contained single-function previews (no project-local refs, no focus/animation)
  again render without compiling. Complex code (control flow, ternary, helper calls,
  undeclared refs) still declines to the compile path, unchanged.

### Changed

- **Runtime image pull surfaces actionable errors and auto-retries transient
  failures.** A failed `docker pull` of the runtime image previously showed only
  the raw error string and gave up. Pulls now categorize the failure (network /
  auth / not-found / unknown), show a plain-language explanation, and auto-retry
  retryable failures up to 3 times with exponential backoff (1s → 2s → 4s …,
  capped at 16s). On the final failure a **Retry** / **View Logs** action is
  offered (Retry omitted for non-retryable errors such as a missing image), and
  every attempt plus its error category is written to the output channel.
  `not-found` errors fail fast instead of retrying pointlessly, and the progress
  heartbeat interval is now cleared per-attempt so retries can't leak timers.

### Tests

- `cppParser.test.ts`: added an `imperative builder form` suite (declarations,
  `auto`, `AddChildren` references, nested grandchildren, source-line tagging,
  undeclared-variable fallbacks) and flipped the shipped-sample regression guard
  from "non-fluent → compile fallback" to asserting they parse on the fast path.
- `pullImageCommand.test.ts`: added an `analyzePullError` suite covering every
  category, the `shouldRetry` decisions, auth-over-network precedence, and
  case-insensitive matching — plus an auto-retry integration test that recovers
  from a transient network failure on the second attempt.

## [0.46.3] - 2026-06-24

### Docs

- **README (EN + KO)**: documented local **image asset** support — `ImageView` /
  `SetResourceUrl` load files via a path relative to the preview file (staged into
  the runtime automatically). Added a **Development / Pre-push** section covering the
  local golden-render gate (`npm run hooks:install`, `npm run test:e2e`, and the
  `--no-verify` / `SKIP_E2E=1` escape hatches).
- **CLAUDE.md**: noted image-asset staging (`BuildRunner.stageImageAssets`) and the
  golden-runner / golden-CI setup so future changes keep the test copies in sync.

### Dev / CI

- Added a `.githooks/pre-push` hook plus `verify` and `hooks:install` npm scripts:
  run compile + unit tests + the golden render suite locally before each push and
  abort on failure. github-hosted CI can't render complex DALi scenes reliably, so
  the render gate lives on the developer machine; `golden-test.yml` is now
  docker-based and on-demand (`workflow_dispatch`).

## [0.46.2] - 2026-06-24

### Changed

- **Samples reformatted to dali-ui's own sample style** — one blank line between
  each widget block, and a single-child `AddChildren` collapsed onto one line.
  Pure formatting: no statement, literal, or order changes, so previews render
  byte-identical (verified — all 26 golden samples pass unchanged). Makes it
  easier to see which widget each block builds.

### Fixed

- **Golden test runner now handles non-fluent code** (test infrastructure). The
  e2e golden runner re-implements extraction + harness codegen (it cannot import
  the `vscode`-dependent `codeExtractor`/`buildRunner`), and the 0.46.0 migration
  updated the real modules but not these copies — so `broken-image`,
  `font-scale-15` and `zero-arg-entry` rendered broken in the golden suite from
  0.46.0 on, undetected. Fixed the var-decl→`return` guard (`hasStatementReturn`)
  and the UiConfig codegen (sequential `__uiConfig.SetX();` statements instead of
  a fluent `.SetX()` suffix). Golden suite: 26 passed, 0 failed.

### CI

- **Re-enabled the golden screenshot suite in CI** — docker-based on
  github-hosted runners (rendering happens inside the runtime image, so no
  self-hosted DALi SDK is needed), on push/PR to `main` and the dev branch. This
  is the render/extraction safety net that the unit-test-only release workflow
  misses — exactly the gap that let the above regressions ship.

## [0.46.1] - 2026-06-23

> Follow-up fixes after the 0.46.0 non-fluent migration: a CodeLens-preview
> regression and local image assets that never rendered in docker mode.

### Fixed

- **CodeLens "Preview" no longer fails with `'root' was not declared in this scope`.**
  `extractFunctionBody` (the CodeLens-triggered path) rewrote a function body's
  leading `FlexLayout root = …` declaration into a `return`, dropping the
  declaration so the following non-fluent setter statements referenced an
  undeclared `root`. It now skips that rewrite when the body already has a
  statement-level `return` (`hasStatementReturn`), matching `extractPreviewCode`.
  The 0.46.0 migration added this guard to the preview-file/marker path but
  missed the CodeLens path.

### Added

- **Local image assets now render in the preview** (`ImageView::New("…")` /
  `SetResourceUrl("…")`). The docker runtime only bind-mounts the build dir at
  `/work`, so local-file images never existed in the container and every
  image-bearing sample fell back to the gray broken-image placeholder.
  `BuildRunner.stageImageAssets` now resolves each local image path (relative to
  the preview file, or an existing absolute path), copies it into the build
  mount, and rewrites the URL to the in-container path. Remote/unresolvable URLs
  are left to the broken-image placeholder as before.
- The five bundled image samples (`food-delivery`, `music-player`, `smart-home`,
  `fitness-dashboard`, `crypto-portfolio`) now point at portable `assets/<name>`
  paths (they previously hard-coded a stale `…/paperclip/…` absolute path that
  existed on no machine) and render their real photos.

### Tests

- Direct unit tests for `extractFunctionBody` (non-fluent body kept verbatim;
  legacy var-decl→return still works; already-return untouched) — the regression
  guard fails against the pre-fix code.
- Unit tests for `BuildRunner.stageImageAssets` (docker `/work` rewrite, local
  host-path rewrite, absolute-path staging, remote/unresolvable skip, dedup).
- A pure-fs guard (`sampleAssets.test.ts`) that fails if any shipped sample
  references a local image path that does not resolve — this would have caught
  the stale `…/paperclip/…` paths immediately.

## [0.46.0] - 2026-06-23

> **dali-ui non-fluent API migration.** dali-ui removed the fluent (method-chaining)
> builder API (commit `2f1c78c`, 2026-06-08) — builder setters now return `void` and
> `View::Children(...)` was renamed to `View::AddChildren(...)`. This release realigns
> the extension, all samples, and the docker runtime to the current dali-ui so
> previews compile again.

### Fixed

- **Previews compile again against the current dali-ui.** Fluent-chained code failed
  with `invalid use of 'void'` on every `.SetX().SetY()` once dali-ui dropped the
  fluent API; the migration restores compilation on both the local and docker
  runtimes.

### Changed

- **All samples/examples migrated to the non-fluent API.** Every `.preview.dali.cpp`
  and sample/example `.cpp` (59 files) now builds views with sequential `obj.SetX();`
  statements and `AddChildren({ … })` instead of fluent chains. Renders are
  unchanged — colours, sizes, strings, and tree structure are byte-for-byte
  preserved; only the chaining form changed.
- **Harness & codegen realigned.** The harness `UiConfig` setup is now sequential
  statements on a `__uiConfig` local (no chaining) and `buildUiConfigSetup()` emits
  statements; the slice ref-scanner recognises object-typed locals
  (`FlexLayout root = …`) so they are never mis-stubbed; the extractor keeps
  self-returning multi-statement bodies verbatim; `transformVectorChildren` handles
  the new `AddChildren(vector)` statement form.
- **Docker runtime bumped to dali-ui `v2.5.26.10708`** (coordinated 2026-06-17
  core/adaptor/ui snapshot) in `docker/Dockerfile.runtime`; the previously published
  image still shipped the old fluent API. Rebuild & push the runtime image so
  docker-mode users get the matching API.

### Notes

- The C++ fast-path parser only understands fluent chains, so non-fluent previews now
  take the (correct) compile path; click-to-code still works via the compiled
  harness's scene-metadata export.

## [0.45.0] - 2026-06-19

> Preview-experience pass: one guided **Open Examples** tour, the local runtime
> can never draw on your real screen again, and previews default to the **TV FHD
> (1920×1080)** canvas DALi UI apps actually target.

### Added

- **Open Examples — a single guided tour.** One `DALi Preview: Open Examples`
  command copies a 6-folder capability tour (your first preview → preview existing
  code → config & theme → focus & state → real multi-file app → render paths) into
  a folder you pick and opens it in a new window; its index `README.md` opens
  automatically as the guide. Replaces the old, overlapping *Open Sample File* +
  *Open Examples* pair.
- **TV FHD default + preset.** Previews default to **1920×1080** (override per file
  with `// @preview-config: width=…`); the `// @preview-preset: screen-sizes`
  bundle now includes a **TV** frame.
- **One-click Xvfb install** (`DALi Preview: Install Xvfb via Terminal`) for local
  runtime, offered automatically when Xvfb is missing.

### Fixed

- **Local runtime never renders on your real screen.** Previously, if no virtual
  display (Xvfb) was available the renderer fell back to your desktop (`:0`) and a
  preview window flashed/stuck on screen. Now the render paths refuse to run
  without an off-screen display, the virtual-display search scans a wide band
  (`:99`–`:114`) so leftover X servers can't exhaust it, and a clear message (with
  install/reload) is shown instead.

### Changed

- **Field-named preview placeholders.** Auto-synthesised sample text for
  argument/member-driven previews is now named after the field
  (`merchant` → "Merchant", `userName` → "User Name") instead of a uniform
  "Sample", so fields stay distinct and the preview is self-documenting.
- Internal: consolidated the slice-builder test suite (8 → 4 files, no coverage
  lost) and wired the server + multi-file golden runners into `test:e2e:all` /
  `test:release`.

## [0.44.0] - 2026-06-19

> Closes the research-identified gaps so **real, production-shaped dali-ui app code
> previews without being rewritten** — member-function screens, cross-file helpers,
> injected view-models, TV focus, and theme/locale/fontScale config. Every visible
> change is verified by an actual render (golden) plus mutation tests.
>
> ⚠️ **Docker users:** the server-side fidelity fixes (rounded corners, named
> colors, markup, dark token resolution) live in `docker/preview_server.cpp`, which
> is pre-compiled into the runtime image. They are verified via the **local**
> backend; to reach docker-mode users the `dali-preview-runtime` image must be
> rebuilt. Local runtime mode (`daliPreview.runtimeMode: local`) gets them now.

### Added

- **Preview real multi-file app code without rewriting it.** A member-function
  screen (`View Screen::Build()`) that reads member state and calls
  helper/factory functions defined in *other* `.cpp` files — using project
  `#include`d theme tokens — now previews directly: the slicer collects the
  cross-file helpers/types and auto-synthesizes sample data for the injected
  view-model. Demonstrated end-to-end on `samples/flow-wallet/` (a 6-file
  commercial-shaped app) via the new `npm run test:e2e:multifile`. This is the
  dominant real-world form (member screen + cross-file factories + MVVM + theme
  tokens + multi-file).
- **`// @dali-preview` entry point** — mark a zero-argument factory
  (`View MakeXxxPreview()`) as the preview target; the C++ analog of Compose's
  parameterless `@Preview` wrapper.
- **`// @preview-state: focus=<view>` — focus ring.** Render one item in its
  keyboard-focus state (the highlight TV / D-pad UIs revolve around, previously
  absent from any static render), resolved by the variable name you already wrote.
  `progress=<0..1>` renders an animation already at a given frame.
- **`// @preview-config` knobs now actually apply** (were parse-only / stub):
  `theme=dark` reskins token colors (`UiColor::PRIMARY` / `UiColor("…")`) via a
  dark palette, `fontScale=1.5` scales `_spx`-sized text, `locale=ar` mirrors the
  layout right-to-left (layout only — no fake translation). `// @preview-preset:
  light-dark` (also `locales` / `font-sizes` / `screen-sizes`) expands to several
  config variants shown together in the gallery.
- **Provenance badges.** When the tool synthesizes or approximates something, a
  small pill badge appears above the preview (sample data / untranslated /
  background-only theme / focus approximated / image placeholder / focus not in
  multi-config) so the "silent fix" is visible. A clean preview shows none.
- **Broken-image placeholder.** An unreachable `ImageView` URL renders a sized gray
  placeholder (keeps the layout box) via `UiConfig::SetBrokenImageUrl`, instead of
  collapsing to an empty view.

### Fixed

- **Server fast-path render fidelity (silent-wrong rendering).** The resident
  scene-builder now honors setters it previously dropped on the parser fast path:
  `SetCornerRadius` (rounded corners were square), named / `.WithAlpha` colors
  (were black), method-form `SetText` / `SetResourceUrl` / `SetMarkupEnabled`, and
  `SetOpacity` / `SetVisibility` / borderline. An unknown color now renders a loud
  magenta (never black) so the gap stays visible. (`docker/preview_server.cpp`)
- **Cross-file compile errors map to your real file.** A typo in a helper in
  another `.cpp` now reports at that file's actual line (e.g.
  `widgets/cards.cpp:38`) — via injected `#line` directives — instead of an
  unmappable line inside the generated harness.

### Internal

- New execution-test infrastructure: `test:e2e:server` (renders the server
  scene-builder path via the local backend — distinct from the harness path) and
  `test:e2e:multifile` (compiles + renders a multi-file app). Unit suite 559 → 654.

## [0.43.1] - 2026-06-18

### Fixed

- **Docker mode no longer pops a spurious "Xvfb is not installed" warning on
  startup.** Activation started a host Xvfb display *unconditionally*, even in the
  default `docker` runtime where rendering happens inside the container (which
  carries its own X server). Hosts without `xvfb` — i.e. most docker users — got a
  misleading *"Xvfb is not installed. Install it with: sudo apt install xvfb"*
  toast they never needed to act on. Host Xvfb is now started only when
  `runtimeMode` is `local` (the host-rendering path that actually uses it).
  Switching to local reloads the window, so Xvfb starts then. Added a
  `hostXvfbNeeded()` predicate with unit tests. (`src/extension.ts`,
  `src/configurationService.ts`)

## [0.43.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added

- **Local DALi runtime preview — for DALi framework (uifw) developers.** A new
  `daliPreview.runtimeMode` setting (`docker` default | `local`) renders previews
  against a host-installed DALi instead of the container. In local mode the
  extension compiles a **native resident preview server** from the bundled
  `preview_server.cpp` against your DALi prefix and spawns it under Xvfb, so the
  parser/dlopen fast paths **and animation scrubbing** work just like docker —
  editing preview code is fast, not a full ~1.7s rebuild each time. For framework
  developers who rebuild DALi itself, a freshly-built `libdali2-*.so` is picked up
  automatically: a watcher on `…/lib/libdali2-*.so` restarts the resident server
  on a rebuild. With no valid prefix configured, local mode falls back to a
  one-shot harness compile. App developers are unaffected — `docker` stays the
  default. Documented as a prominent section in the README (EN + KO). SDB device
  preview, VNC, and GIF capture are **not** revived.
- **Command: Use Local DALi Runtime** — opens a folder picker (pre-seeded with an
  auto-detected prefix; accepts a parent that contains `dali-env/opt`), validates
  it (`dali2-ui-foundation.pc` + g++/Xvfb/pkg-config), saves `daliPreview.daliPrefix`,
  and reloads.
- **Command: Restart DALi Runtime** (local mode) — respawn the resident server to
  load your latest DALi build.

### Changed

- **Internal `BuildBackend` seam.** BuildRunner's harness templating is now
  backend-agnostic; the docker container/`/work` path duality is encapsulated in
  `DockerBackend`, and `LocalBackend` drives the native g++/pkg-config build.
- **DALi prefix auto-detection is shared-tool-safe.** Order: the
  `daliPreview.daliPrefix` setting → `$DESKTOP_PREFIX` (what a dali-env `setenv`
  exports) → a workspace `setenv` file → a system/shared install
  (`pkg-config`-registered, then `/opt/dali`). It no longer scans personal
  home/project dirs (`~/dali-env/opt`, `~/tizen/*`), so a shared install never
  auto-selects one developer's build.
- **Select Runtime Version** is now visible in the Command Palette and is the
  Docker-mode entry point — it picks a container/DALi version and, when run from
  local mode, switches into Docker. The separate *Use Docker Runtime* command was
  removed (its role is now covered by Select Runtime Version).

### Fixed

- **CodeLens previews no longer fall back to the slow path.** A CodeLens-only
  workflow (a regular `.cpp` with no markers) never started the resident preview
  server, so every live edit recompiled the full harness (~1.7s). Clicking the
  ▶ Preview CodeLens now starts the server, so live edits use the fast path.
- **Use Local DALi Runtime no longer re-prompts a reload when already active.**
  Re-running it while already in local mode with the same prefix now reports
  "Already using the local DALi runtime" instead of asking to reload again (it
  still updates + reloads when you pick a different prefix).

## [0.42.0] - 2026-06-15

### Added

- **Compose-style animation preview (scrubbing).** Previews that contain DALi
  `Animation`s now show a scrubber + play/pause bar under the image. Dragging
  the slider renders the *exact* frame at that point in the animation timeline
  — deterministic `Animation::SetCurrentProgress(t)` on the resident plugin —
  and play steps through it. No GIF baking and no recompile per frame; the
  longest-animation duration drives the timeline. The scrubber sits in a bottom
  bar with a caption + current/total time. **Smooth playback:** frames are
  rendered lazily and cached by index in the webview (a bounded set, independent
  of the animation's length), and a background prefetch warms the cache after
  the preview is already showing (yielding to user input) — so replay and
  re-scrubbing run at 60fps from cache without ever pre-capturing up front.
  Demo samples (in `test/samples/animation/`) covering the common animation
  shapes: `animation-scrub` (pulsing FAB, looping scale), `progress-bar`
  (determinate fill via SCALE_X), `toast-slide` (slide-up + fade-in),
  `loader-bar` (indeterminate AUTO_REVERSE loop) — all verified rendering +
  scrubbing against the real runtime. Mechanism: the build step
  auto-injects `__RegisterPreviewAnimation(<anim>)` after each `<anim>.Play();`
  so the plugin collects animation handles; the preview server gained a
  `RENDER_AT <progress>` command that re-renders the already-loaded plugin and
  reports `>>>ANIM:<count>:<durationMs>` on load; rendering stays entirely in
  the container. Named animations only — method-chained temporaries have no
  handle to scrub. (Verified end-to-end against the real runtime image.)

### Removed

- **The extension is now docker-only.** Removed the local/native DALi runtime
  (host g++/pkg-config compile, the `daliPrefix` / `tizenSysroot` /
  `runtimeMode` settings, the setup wizard, and the *Use Native/Docker Runtime*
  commands), **SDB device preview**, **animation GIF capture** (superseded by
  scrubbing), and **VNC interactive mode**. The container path (parser / dlopen
  / harness) covers all preview rendering, so this drops ~16 files plus a large
  amount of native-only code and its maintenance burden.

### Fixed

- **Animation scrubbing no longer leaks frames between previews.** Switching
  between animated previews (or scrubbing several in succession) could flash the
  previous preview's frames or show a wrong frame — background-prefetch and
  in-flight scrub renders from the old preview arrived after the new one loaded.
  Each render now carries a generation (epoch): the orchestrator rejects scrubs
  for a stale epoch or while a fresh render is in progress (re-checking after the
  render completes), and the webview discards any scrub frame whose epoch doesn't
  match the current preview. (Server-side: confirmed the plugin's animation
  registry does NOT accumulate across reloads.)
- **Scrubbing no longer collapses to the end after an animation plays out.** A
  non-looping animation that ran to completion BAKEs its end values into the
  properties, after which `SetCurrentProgress` could no longer move it — so
  re-opening/​re-viewing a finished preview showed only a tiny twitch near the
  end. The plugin now `Pause()`s each animation at registration (so it never
  finishes + bakes) and seeks via `SetCurrentProgress` only — never re-`Play()`,
  which would re-capture a drifted start value. Verified deterministic across
  immediate and post-playout scrubs for looping and non-looping samples.
- **Animation-scrub robustness sweep (18 scenarios + adversarial code review).**
  Fixed: scrub frames were written to a rotating `preview_scrub_<n%8>.png` that
  aliased distinct cached frames onto one file (a re-read after eviction showed
  the wrong frame) — now named by progress for a stable backing file; the
  `>>>ANIM:<count>:<dur>` info could leak from a superseded reload onto the next
  render's OK (wrong scrubber duration) — now cleared whenever the in-flight
  request is replaced; the `.Play()` injection captured only the last identifier,
  so `this->anim`/`obj.anim` registered an undeclared name and broke compilation
  — now captures the full handle chain; a scrub the extension can't serve (epoch
  mismatch / mid-render) left the webview stalled ~5 s on its watchdog — the
  extension now NACKs so the slot frees immediately; and a single-fn preview
  containing an animation routed through the parser path (no `>>>ANIM`) showed no
  scrubber — now routed to the dlopen path. A 18-case sweep (looping/​non-looping,
  AnimateTo/​By/​KeyFrames, position/​scale/​size/​colour/​orientation, multi-anim,
  ease/​duration variants) verifies determinism, range, and no-bake against the
  real runtime.

## [0.41.1] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- **Korean / CJK text now renders in the docker preview.** The runtime image
  shipped only DejaVu fonts (no CJK glyphs), so Hangul / Chinese / Japanese
  rendered as tofu (□). Baked **Noto Sans CJK** into the runtime image so the
  preview font resolves CJK codepoints — matching real Tizen devices, which
  have CJK fonts. Latin text still resolves to DejaVu first, so existing
  previews are pixel-identical (19/20 goldens byte-unchanged; the
  `multi-config-locale` golden updated from `□□□□□?` to `안녕하세요?`). The Serif
  CJK collection is stripped (previews render sans) to keep image growth small
  (+~80 MB). Added a `korean-label` sample + golden as a CJK regression guard.

### Changed

- **Internal code-quality refactor (behavior-preserving).** Deduplicated the
  `buildRunner` build methods behind shared harness/font/background helpers,
  decomposed the long `runPreview` and `activate` functions, unified the
  orchestrator's compiler-error failure paths through a single
  `diagnoseGccErrors`, routed stray `console.error` / swallowed errors through
  the logger, fixed a config drift bug (re-hardcoded docker image/tag), and
  dropped dead types. No user-facing behavior change — verified by 616 unit
  tests + golden e2e 21/21. Added characterization tests for the preview
  orchestrator's concurrency guards (previously 0% covered).

## [0.41.0] - 2026-06-11 — Zero-annotation auto-extract preview

Preview real app code — helpers, member functions, MVVM models, cross-file
components — without adding any preview annotations.

### Added

- **Automatic dependency extraction.** Previewing a helper/factory/member
  function (or a whole screen) no longer needs a self-contained snippet: the
  extension collects the same-file *and* cross-file (transitive `#include`)
  definitions the code references, injects sample data for model structs, and
  weak-stubs whatever is left. Real dali-ui patterns — helper/factory functions,
  class member assembly, MVVM model injection, theme constants, header splits,
  `for`-loop data binding — render as-is.
- **Arg-receiving UI preview.** Functions that take parameters
  (`MakeStatCard(label, value, accent)`) get a **"▶ Preview (sample args)"**
  CodeLens that fills in sample values. For meaningful values, add a `// @preview`
  wrapper that calls them with real literals.
- **`vector` → `.Children`.** A `.Children(rows)` where `rows` is a
  `std::vector<View>` built by a loop now renders (auto-rewritten to an `.Add`
  loop — `View::Children` only accepts an initializer list).
- **click-to-code on cross-file helpers.** Clicking a `MakeSectionHeader(...)`
  result in the preview jumps to that call site, not just `Type::New()` calls.

### Fixed

- **Resize & resolution apply immediately** — picking a resolution or typing a
  size updates the preview right away instead of only after **Ctrl+S**, including
  files previewed via CodeLens (no `// @preview` marker).
- **Overlay highlights line up with the render.** The click-to-code and layout
  overlays now honour `object-fit: contain` (uniform scale + letterbox), so boxes
  no longer stretch or drift when the panel isn't 16:9.
- **Full-harness render path** now injects the extracted globals too (previously
  only the fast dlopen path did), fixing "`theme` has not been declared" on the
  fallback path.
- **Emoji with no glyph in the preview font** (☀⛅☁☂ across separate Labels) are
  shown as **□** instead of aborting the render. Real devices have emoji fonts;
  this only affects the preview runtime.

### Changed

- **Removed drag-to-resize** from the preview panel — resize via the resolution
  dropdown or the width/height inputs.

## [0.40.0] - 2026-06-10 — Curl-free Docker setup, preview-time install prompt & a calmer panel

### Fixed

- **Files using a nested builder chain as an argument — most commonly
  `.SetLayoutParams(StackLayoutParams::New().SetWeight(1.0f))` — now render on
  the fast T1 parser path (<100 ms) instead of being forced onto the ~1.2 s
  compile path.** The TypeScript chain parser (`src/cppParser.ts`) previously
  accepted a single call as an argument value (`UiColor(0x…)`, `Extents(…)`) but
  not a call followed by further `.Method(…)` chaining, so one such line made
  `parseChainExpression` return `null` and demoted the **entire** file to the
  dlopen path. A single weighted spacer in a 283-line screen was enough to cost
  a full second per keystroke. The parser now accepts a nested builder chain
  **only when the base is itself a `Type::New(...)`-style call**, so a bare
  member access like `model.GetTitle()` still falls through to the compile path
  as before. This restored seven sample screens (the three `flow-banking`
  screens plus `boarding-pass`, `crypto-portfolio`, `fitness-dashboard`,
  `food-delivery`) to the parser path. See `code_preview_strategy_0610.md` for
  the full pattern-support analysis.
- **The render server now honours `SetLayoutParams` on the T1 path**
  (`server/preview_server.cpp`): `StackLayoutParams::New().SetWeight(w)` and
  `FlexLayoutParams::New().SetFlexGrow/Shrink/Basis(...)` are parsed out of the
  captured chain and applied to the child view, so a weighted spacer pushes its
  siblings to the far edge exactly as it does on the compile path. (Takes effect
  once the runtime image is rebuilt; the host falls back gracefully until then.)
- **`DALi: Install Docker via Terminal` no longer fails on a machine without
  `curl`.** The generated install command began with `curl … | sudo sh`, so on
  an Ubuntu box that ships without curl the whole `&&` chain aborted at the very
  first step. The downloader is now robust — it prefers `curl`, falls back to
  `wget`, and only if neither exists installs `curl` via apt first — then runs
  the same no-reboot install/permission chain. The command is centralized in a
  unit-tested `buildDockerInstallCommand()` (one source of truth), and the
  "Manual instructions" output was updated to match. (`src/installDocker.ts`,
  `src/dockerAccessCheck.ts`.)
- **Attempting a preview while Docker is missing now surfaces the actionable
  setup popup instead of a raw error buried in the panel — and resumes a
  half-finished install with no reload.** Previously, if first-run setup was
  dismissed or its terminal was closed mid-install, a later save / `▶ Preview`
  fell through to the harness path and printed `Docker is not available…` as
  plain text in the webview. `PreviewOrchestrator.runPreview` now gates
  docker-mode renders on a docker-access check (`decidePreviewDockerGate`): when
  Docker is missing it shows the same install / "fix permissions" / "start
  daemon" guidance the onboarding uses (whichever applies), then the existing
  poller pulls the image and starts the server with **no VS Code reload**.
  Live-preview keystrokes stay silent (no modal, no panel error), and a shared
  8-second throttle prevents focus-then-save double-prompts. (`src/previewOrchestrator.ts`,
  `src/dockerAccessCheck.ts`, `src/extension.ts`.)

### Changed

- **The preview panel no longer auto-opens when you focus or type in a DALi
  file — it opens only on an explicit gesture (Ctrl+S, the `DALi Preview: Open
  Preview` command, or the `▶ Preview` CodeLens) and stays closed once you
  close it with (×).** Previously the active-editor handler called
  `previewManager.show()` on every focus change, and live-preview re-showed the
  panel on every keystroke, so a panel the user dismissed kept reappearing the
  moment they switched back to the file or typed a character. Both the
  focus-change and live-preview paths now bail out unless the panel is already
  visible (`previewManager?.isVisible`); save (the documented "Ctrl+S to render"
  gesture) and the explicit commands still open it. (`src/extension.ts`.)
- **Curated the Command Palette: typing "preview" no longer surfaces a wall of
  internal commands.** 13 commands that are reachable from the setup
  walkthrough, the CodeLens button, or are device/maintenance/runtime actions
  are now hidden from the palette via `contributes.menus.commandPalette`
  (`when: false`) — they remain registered, so walkthrough buttons, CodeLens,
  and programmatic callers are unaffected. The palette now lists only the seven
  core commands (Open Preview, Toggle Theme, Toggle Interactive Mode, Open
  Settings, Open Sample File, Open Examples, Run Setup Walkthrough). `Open
  Preview` was also normalized to the shared `DALi Preview` category so every
  visible entry is consistently prefixed. A new `commandPalette.test.ts` locks
  in the visible/hidden split and fails if a future command is added without
  classifying it. (`package.json`, `test/unit/commandPalette.test.ts`.)

## [0.39.3] - 2026-06-09 — Honest, always-moving download progress

### Changed

- **Runtime-image download no longer shows a percentage — it shows an
  indeterminate (always-animating) bar with a live "N/M layers · elapsed"
  status.** This supersedes the per-layer percentage from 0.39.1. Off-TTY
  (how the extension always spawns `docker pull`) docker emits **no** byte or
  percent detail — the `Downloading [===>] X/Y` bar is a TTY-only feature drawn
  with carriage returns. Any percent we computed was therefore a coarse
  per-layer mean in which a 1 KB layer and the ~290 MB DALi layer each counted
  equally, so the bar sat near a low number for most of the download and read as
  "stuck" (and felt slower than it was). The download itself is unchanged and
  network-bound; the only honest signals available off-TTY are completed-layer
  milestones and elapsed time, so that is all we show now. The notification
  reports no `increment`, which keeps VS Code's bar in its continuously
  animating indeterminate state, and a 1 s heartbeat ticks the elapsed clock so
  it is visibly working between milestones. Progress-bar precision is
  deliberately traded away in favour of a download that always looks alive.
  (`src/pullImageCommand.ts`; new `formatPullMessage` unit tests.)

## [0.39.2] - 2026-06-09 — Re-armable first-run Docker setup

### Fixed

- **The first-run "install Docker" popup never reappeared after a reset.** The
  proactive onboarding is gated by a once-per-machine globalState flag
  (`daliPreview.dockerOnboarding.v1`), and that flag **survives an extension
  uninstall/reinstall** — VS Code keeps globalState keyed by extension id. Since
  nothing cleared it, a developer (or user) who removed Docker and reinstalled
  could never get the guided setup prompt again; it silently short-circuited at
  `if (alreadyShown) return`. `DALi: Reset Extension` now also clears the
  first-run flags (`clearFirstRunFlags`), re-arming both the Docker onboarding
  and the setup walkthrough — done through the globalState Memento, which is
  race-free (unlike editing `state.vscdb` behind a running VS Code). The
  companion `dali-docker-reset.sh` test script clears the same flag, so wiping
  Docker re-arms the popup in one step. (`src/dockerMaintenance.ts`,
  `src/extension.ts`.)

## [0.39.1] - 2026-06-09 — Smooth runtime-image download progress

### Fixed

- **Runtime-image download progress jumped straight from 0% to 100% and then
  looked frozen.** The extension spawns `docker pull` with a piped (non-TTY)
  stdout, and in that mode docker prints only discrete per-layer milestones
  (`Pulling fs layer` → `Download complete` → `Pull complete`) — never the
  byte/percent `Downloading [===>] X/Y` bar, which is a TTY-only feature drawn
  with carriage returns. The old parser matched only that never-emitted percent
  line, so its average could only ever be 0 or 100; the first completed layer
  pinned it at 100% while the big ~290 MB layer was still downloading. Progress
  is now computed from the milestones docker actually emits (each layer scored
  across its queued → downloaded → extracted phases, averaged over all layers
  and held monotonic), and the notification ticks an elapsed-time heartbeat so it
  stays visibly alive while a layer downloads silently. (`src/dockerRuntime.ts`
  `PullProgressTracker`, `src/pullImageCommand.ts`.)

## [0.39.0] - 2026-06-09 — Proactive first-run Docker setup

### Added

- **First-run Docker onboarding that no longer needs a preview file.** The
  extension now also activates on `onStartupFinished`, so right after install it
  proactively offers (once per machine) to install Docker and download the
  runtime image — instead of staying dormant until you happened to open a
  `.preview.dali.cpp` file. Consenting runs the no-reboot install and then
  auto-pulls the ~290 MB image and starts the preview server. Native-mode users
  still get the setup walkthrough. (`src/dockerOnboarding.ts`.)

### Fixed

- **Duplicate "Downloading runtime image (~290 MB)" popup during first-time
  setup.** `ensureRuntimeImage` is called independently by the preview-server
  init, every preview render, and the post-install docker-access poller, with no
  mutual exclusion — so a second trigger that fired while the first pull was
  still running saw `hasImage === false` and started its *own* download. Pulls
  are now coalesced by image tag, so concurrent callers share a single download
  and a single progress notification. The activation-time preview-server init no
  longer shows its own docker-setup modal either (the onboarding owns that
  prompt), preventing a double popup.

## [0.38.0] - 2026-06-08 — Offline version switcher + Examples tour

### Added

- **`DALi: Open Examples`** — copies a guided, one-folder-per-mode example tour
  into a location you choose and opens it in a **new window**, so throwaway
  example edits never mix with (or dirty the git state of) your real project.
  Covers all five preview modes: `*.preview.dali.cpp` files, the `// @preview`
  marker, CodeLens (Code-to-Preview), `// @preview-config` multi-config, and the
  three build paths (parser / dlopen / full build), each with its own README.

### Changed

- **`DALi: Select Runtime Version` now works offline and shows what's cached.**
  It merges locally-downloaded image tags with the registry's, marks each entry
  `downloaded` / `will download`, and lets you switch to any already-pulled
  version instantly — even with no network — so you can flip between DALi
  releases to compare how a layout renders. Rolling tags like `latest` also
  show their concrete DALi version on a second line (read instantly from the
  image's `io.dalihub.dali.version` label — no slow registry round-trip), so
  you always know which release you're on. (New `DockerRuntime.listLocalTags()`
  / `getImageVersionLabel()`.)

### Fixed

- Regenerated the `red-box` / `animation` golden harness fixtures that had
  drifted after the dali 2.5.19+ `Signal::Connect` member→lambda fix (d971a62),
  restoring a fully green unit suite.

## [0.37.2] - 2026-06-04 — User-facing README rewrite

### Changed

- **README rewritten as a user-facing guide** (English + Korean). The old README
  read like a development-planning document — a feature/phase status matrix, a
  cross-framework comparison table, and internal-implementation notes. Replaced
  with: a value-focused intro, a grouped feature list, explicit Requirements, a
  4-step Quick Start, runtime setup (Docker vs native), preview authoring
  (`.preview.dali.cpp`, markers, `@preview-config`/multi-preview, CodeLens), and
  reference tables for **Commands**, **Settings**, and **Troubleshooting**.
- Documentation now reflects the shipped v0.37 feature set — Docker runtime as the
  default, the guided setup walkthrough, runtime update policy + version picker,
  multi-preview, Widget Inspector, Code-to-Preview, interactive (VNC) mode, and
  device preview — instead of the obsolete "Phase 2/3/4 — planned" framing. Code
  examples corrected to the real `.Set*` chaining API.

### Fixed

- `package.json` `repository.url` corrected to the canonical
  `https://github.com/dalihub/vscode-dali-ui-preview` (was a stale fork URL), so
  the Marketplace "Repository" link resolves correctly.

## [0.37.1] - 2026-06-04 — DALi 2.5.24 runtime + harness compat fix

### Fixed

- **Harness templates compile against the latest DALi.** An upstream dali
  `signal.h` refactor (2026-04-21: `SignalMixin`, raw-Impl ptr) broke the
  standard member `Signal::Connect(this, &Class::Method)` — it mis-resolves to
  the functor overload and fails to compile on dali 2.5.19+. Converted all
  member Connects to lambdas (functor path) in `preview_server` and the
  harness / animation / interactive templates. Verified: renders `dali_2.5.24`
  to a 1024×600 PNG.

### Changed

- **Runtime image refreshed to `dali_2.5.24`** (was `dali_2.5.18`), pushed to
  `ghcr.io/lwc0917/dali-preview-runtime` as `dali_2.5.24` + `latest`. With
  `daliVersionTag=latest` (default) clients pick it up automatically.
- **Dockerfile: dropped the dali-toolkit build stage.** dali-ui is an
  independent UI framework that doesn't link `dali2-toolkit`, and
  preview_server/harness use `dali-ui-foundation` only — so toolkit was built
  but never linked. Removing it shrinks the image and speeds the build.

## [0.37.0] - 2026-06-04 — Update policy + version picker

### Added

- **`daliPreview.runtimeUpdatePolicy`** setting (`off` / `notify` / `auto`).
  The daily update check follows it: `notify` (default) shows a status-bar
  badge + "Update now" notification; `auto` downloads and applies the update in
  the background; `off` disables checking entirely.
- **`dali.selectRuntimeVersion`** command — lists the available image tags from
  the registry (GHCR), lets you pick one, then pulls it and restarts the
  preview server on that version.
- `registryClient.listRemoteTags` — anonymous GHCR token + `/v2/.../tags/list`.

### Changed

- Replaced the boolean `daliPreview.autoCheckRuntimeUpdate` with the three-way
  `daliPreview.runtimeUpdatePolicy` (`off` == the old `false`; `notify`/`auto`
  == the old `true`, now with a choice of how the update is applied).

## [0.36.3] - 2026-06-04 — Setup UX polish

### Fixed

- The runtime-image download progress notification now closes as soon as the
  pull hits 100%. The completion toast is fire-and-forget instead of awaited —
  awaiting it had kept the "100% — complete" bar on screen until dismissed.

### Changed

- The install terminal now **auto-runs** the install command, so you go
  straight to the sudo password prompt instead of pressing Enter first.
- The Docker-setup wait notification shows a plain "Installing Docker —
  waiting for it to become available…" message instead of an "attempt n/150"
  counter that looked like you had to wait for 150 tries.

## [0.36.2] - 2026-06-04 — Visible Docker-setup progress

### Added

- **Progress notification while waiting for Docker.** After the install/setfacl
  step, a cancellable "DALi Preview · Docker setup" notification shows
  "Waiting for Docker access… (attempt n/max)" so the wait is never silent. On
  success it hands off to the image-download progress bar; on timeout it
  surfaces a "did not become available" warning instead of hanging quietly.
- `DockerAccessPoller` gained `onTick` (per-probe progress) and `onGiveUp`
  (exhaustion) callbacks; the install / verify / guidance / use-docker paths
  all route through the new progress-wrapped watcher.

## [0.36.1] - 2026-06-04 — Setup guidance fixes

### Fixed

- The activation `docker-not-installed` guidance now drives the no-reboot
  install flow (`installDockerCommand`: pre-install modal → terminal with the
  setfacl chain → access poller) instead of only printing manual instructions
  to the Output channel. The previous "Install instructions" button was a dead
  end — it never opened the install terminal or started the poller.
- `buildRunner`'s docker-unavailable error no longer says "re-launch VS Code";
  it now points to **"DALi: Install Docker via Terminal"** (no reboot needed).

## [0.36.0] - 2026-06-02 — Runtime image update management

### Added

- **Update detection via digest comparison.** `DockerRuntime` gained
  `getLocalDigest` / `getRemoteDigest` / `isUpdateAvailable`, comparing the
  locally-cached image's `RepoDigest` against the registry manifest digest
  (`docker buildx imagetools inspect`, falling back to `docker manifest
  inspect`). Works for any tag (rolling `latest` or pinned) with no auth/HTTP
  handling, and never throws — offline/unknown is treated as "no update".
- **`dali.checkRuntimeUpdate`** command — manual "check for updates"; on a
  newer image, offers "Update now" → force re-pull → restarts the preview
  server on the new image.
- **Daily background auto-check** on activation (docker mode only), throttled
  to once per day via `globalState`, gated by the new
  `daliPreview.autoCheckRuntimeUpdate` setting (default `true`). Non-blocking
  and silent when offline or up to date.
- **Status-bar "Update available"** affordance — click it to run the update
  check.

### Note

Digest comparison detects a changed image for the *configured* tag; it does
not enumerate new version tags in the registry. To move to a new DALi version
tag, set `daliPreview.daliVersionTag`.

## [0.35.0] - 2026-06-02 — Seamless no-reboot Docker setup

### Added

- **No-reboot Docker setup.** The install flow now grants the current
  VS Code session docker socket access immediately via `setfacl` (file
  ACLs are evaluated at connect-time, so the already-running editor picks
  them up) — no logout or reboot. A new background poller
  (`DockerAccessPoller`) watches for access to become available after the
  install and continues setup automatically.
- **`ensureRuntimeImage`** — the runtime image is auto-pulled with a
  progress notification before the preview server launches (and on the
  harness fallback path), instead of letting `docker run` cold-pull
  ~290 MB past the 15 s startup timeout and silently fail.
- **"Fix for this session"** action on the docker permission-denied
  guidance — applies the same immediate `setfacl` fix for users who
  already installed Docker but whose session never picked up the group.

### Changed

- **Pre-install modal** before the install terminal opens: "enter your
  password once; the rest is automatic; no reboot or reload."
- **`dali.useDockerRuntime`** now ensures the image and (re)starts the
  preview server in place instead of asking the user to reload the window.
- `installDockerCommand` / `showInstallDocs` / walkthrough step 3 no longer
  tell the user to reboot.

### Note on ACL persistence

The `setfacl` socket ACL bridges the current session only; it is lost if
the docker daemon recreates the socket (e.g. `systemctl restart docker`).
The permanent path is the `usermod -aG docker` group membership, which
applies to every future session — re-run "Verify Docker Access" →
"Fix for this session" if access ever drops mid-session.

## [0.34.5] - 2026-04-29 — Default debounce 0ms (instant live preview)

### Changed

- `daliPreview.livePreviewDebounce` default flipped from `300` ms to
  `0` ms. With the parser fast path running inside the long-running
  docker container (~100 ms per update), the 300 ms wait was the
  largest single contributor to perceived latency on every keystroke.
  Users on the slow harness path can raise this back to 300+ to
  coalesce edits.

### Note on first-render slowness

If your very first preview takes ~1.5–2 s and the Output channel
shows `buildAndRun (full harness): ~1800ms`, the docker `preview_server`
container hadn't finished starting yet when you hit save. Reload the
window once after the extension finishes activating — the first
`>>>READY` log line confirms the container is up. Subsequent renders
hit the parser fast path (~100 ms).

## [0.34.4] - 2026-04-29 — Visible runtime download + walkthrough completion fix

### Fixed

- **Walkthrough steps marked done at unintended times.** Step 2 (Pick
  Runtime) used `onSettingChanged:daliPreview.runtimeMode` as its
  completion event, which could fire as a side effect of other
  settings changes. Tightened to button-driven events:
  `onCommand:dali.useDockerRuntime` or
  `onCommand:dali.useNativeRuntime`. Same approach applied across the
  walkthrough — each step now completes only when its own button is
  clicked, not when an unrelated setting changes.
- After installing Docker via the walkthrough, no visible
  download/install of the DALi runtime image happened — the image
  pull was silently deferred to the first preview render, leaving the
  user with no progress feedback during the ~290 MB download.

### Added

- **`dali.pullRuntimeImage`** command — pulls the DALi runtime image
  from GHCR with a VS Code progress notification (percentage in the
  bottom-right). Skips silently when the image is already cached.
- **New walkthrough step "Download DALi Runtime Image"** between
  Install Docker and Open Sample. After the user verifies Docker
  access in step 3, an info message offers to download the image
  immediately so step 6 (Open Sample) is instant.
- **Auto-prompt after Verify Docker.** When `dali.verifyDocker`
  succeeds, the user gets an info message offering to download the
  runtime image right away. Opting in kicks off the pull with the
  progress notification.

### Changed

- Walkthrough is now 6 steps (was 5) — the new "Download DALi Runtime
  Image" step makes the previously invisible pull step visible.

## [0.34.3] - 2026-04-29 — Walkthrough UX polish

### Changed

- **Walkthrough now has 5 steps and presents both runtime options.**
  Previously the flow assumed Docker; users with an existing native
  DALi install had no in-walkthrough path. Reorganised:
  1. **Welcome** — overview of how the extension works
  2. **Choose Your Runtime** — Docker (Recommended) ⭐ vs Native
     buttons
  3. **Install Docker (Recommended path)** — pre-fills install
     command in terminal
  4. **Configure Native DALi (alternative path)** — runs the legacy
     setup wizard against an existing host install
  5. **Open a Sample** — moved to the **end**, after the runtime is
     ready
- "Open Documentation" link in the Welcome step now opens the bundled
  README.md in VS Code's markdown preview (was incorrectly opening
  the Settings page).
- `dali.useDockerRuntime` command title gains "(Recommended)" badge.

### Added

- **`dali.useNativeRuntime`** command — confirms with the user, sets
  `daliPreview.runtimeMode` to `'native'`, prompts reload. The setup
  wizard then fires for prefix selection.
- **`dali.showReadme`** command — opens the bundled README.md as a
  markdown preview. Wired to the Welcome step.

## [0.34.2] - 2026-04-29 — Docker by default + suppress legacy first-run popups

### Changed

- **`daliPreview.runtimeMode` default flipped from `native` to `docker`.**
  Existing users with the setting explicitly set are unaffected. New
  installs now go through the walkthrough's docker setup path by
  default, matching the rest of the first-run UX.

### Fixed

- The "Select your DALi installation folder" dialog and the "Required
  dependencies missing" toast still appeared on first install in
  v0.34.1 because the previous fix only skipped them when
  `runtimeMode === 'docker'` — but the **default was still `native`**,
  so a fresh install always tripped both popups before reaching the
  walkthrough. v0.34.2 suppresses both whenever the walkthrough has
  not yet been shown on this machine (`globalState` flag), regardless
  of the resolved runtime mode. The walkthrough alone drives the
  initial UX.

## [0.34.1] - 2026-04-29 — Skip native setup wizard in docker mode

### Fixed

- The legacy "Select your DALi installation folder" dialog from
  `setupWizard.ts` was firing on first activation regardless of
  `runtimeMode`, blocking the new walkthrough behind a modal that
  asked docker-mode users to point at a host DALi prefix that
  doesn't exist. The wizard now runs only when `runtimeMode ===
  'native'`. The `validateEnvironment` host-deps check (g++ / Xvfb /
  pkg-config / native DALi prefix) is also skipped in docker mode
  since those live inside the runtime image.

## [0.34.0] - 2026-04-29 — Phase 5 — Docker Runtime + Walkthrough

### Highlights

The extension now ships a fully-Dockerized DALi runtime, so users no
longer have to install DALi on their host machine. All three preview
paths (parser / dlopen / full harness) work inside a long-running
container, with measured performance close to native mode on small
canvases:

- **parser path**: 45–150 ms per text-change (warm)
- **dlopen path**: ~500 ms per change (uses `docker exec` against the
  running preview server, avoids cold-container startup)
- **full harness path**: ~1.5 s (fallback)

A 4-step walkthrough opens automatically on first launch, guiding users
through Docker install → switching to docker mode → opening a bundled
sample. New maintenance commands let users free disk space and reset
the docker state without touching the CLI directly.

### Added

- **`docker/Dockerfile.runtime`** — multi-stage build producing
  `ghcr.io/lwc0917/dali-preview-runtime:dali_2.5.18` (290 MB pull).
  Pins `dali-core/adaptor/toolkit` to specific SHAs (dali_2.5.18 + 4
  commits, where the Extents API moved from uint16 → int16) and
  `dali-ui` to commit `bec04e3` (devel branch HEAD that uses
  integration-api/visual-renderer.h). Includes Tizen-patched `tizenvg`
  built from `git://review.tizen.org/git/platform/core/graphics/tizenvg`
  (upstream ThorVG lacks the SVG fixes DALi needs).
- **`docker/entrypoint.sh`** — one-shot full-harness compile + render
  for the slow-path docker run.
- **`docker/serve.sh`** — long-running preview_server entry. The
  preview_server binary is now pre-compiled in the image, so the
  extension never compiles it on the user's machine in docker mode.
- **`src/dockerRuntime.ts`** — `DockerRuntime` class wrapping `docker
  info`, image hash check, image pull, and two compile/render entry
  points (`buildAndCapture` for full harness, `compilePlugin` for
  dlopen). `compilePlugin` uses `docker exec` against the running
  preview_server container when available, saving ~300–500 ms of
  container startup per compile.
- **`src/dockerAccessCheck.ts`** — probes `docker info`, classifies the
  failure (CLI missing / daemon down / permission denied / unknown),
  and surfaces a contextual modal. Notably, the `permission-denied`
  case explains why logout/login isn't always enough on Linux and
  guides the user toward a reboot when their session has cached the
  old group list.
- **`src/dockerMaintenance.ts`** — three maintenance commands:
  `dali.cleanRuntimeImages` (multi-select QuickPick of cached images,
  stops dependent containers first), `dali.resetExtension` (containers
  + images + cache volumes in one shot), and `dali.verifyDocker`
  (re-check after the user reboots).
- **`src/walkthroughController.ts`** — first-launch detection via
  `globalState`, syncs across machines via `setKeysForSync`. The
  walkthrough is registered under `contributes.walkthroughs` with 4
  steps, each backed by a markdown file in `media/walkthrough/`.
- **`src/installDocker.ts`** — pre-fills the install-and-add-to-group
  command in an integrated terminal; user supplies sudo password once.
- **`src/sampleCommand.ts`** — `dali.openSample` copies the bundled
  `samples/hello-dali.preview.dali.cpp` into the workspace and opens
  it. `dali.useDockerRuntime` flips the setting and prompts for reload.
- **`samples/hello-dali.preview.dali.cpp`** — annotated starter sample
  for the walkthrough's "Open Sample" step.
- **`media/walkthrough/01-welcome.md`** through **`04-first-preview.md`** —
  walkthrough step content.
- **`scripts/build-runtime-local.sh`** — local Dockerfile build with
  GHCR alias auto-tagging and a smoke test.
- **`.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`** — weekly cron + manual
  trigger that resolves the latest dali-toolkit tag, builds the image,
  pushes to GHCR, and prunes versions older than the last 12.
- **Settings**: `daliPreview.runtimeMode` (`native` | `docker`),
  `daliPreview.dockerImage` (defaults to
  `ghcr.io/lwc0917/dali-preview-runtime`), `daliPreview.daliVersionTag`
  (defaults to `latest`).
- **Commands**: `dali.verifyDocker`, `dali.cleanRuntimeImages`,
  `dali.resetExtension`, `dali.openSample`, `dali.useDockerRuntime`,
  `dali.installDocker`, `dali.rerunSetup`.

### Changed

- **`src/previewServer.ts`** — when `runtimeMode === 'docker'`, spawns
  `docker run -i --rm --name dali-preview-server-<hash> ...
  --entrypoint /usr/local/bin/dali-preview-serve <image>` instead of a
  native binary. The container name is registered with `DockerRuntime`
  so dlopen plugin compiles can `docker exec` into the same container.
  Stale containers are removed before spawn, the workspace folder is
  bind-mounted (read-only) so absolute asset paths in user code resolve
  inside the container, and stdout/stderr are line-buffered before
  filtering so log lines split across docker chunks aren't echoed to
  the Output channel as fragments. Adds `LP_NUM_THREADS=0` and
  `GALLIUM_DRIVER=llvmpipe` env vars for portable mesa multi-threaded
  software rendering.
- **`src/buildRunner.ts`** — `buildAndRunDocker` (full harness) and a
  docker branch in `compilePlugin` (dlopen). DockerRuntime is passed
  in the constructor.
- **`src/extension.ts`** — instantiates `DockerRuntime`; runs
  `checkDockerAccess()` before initializing PreviewServer in docker
  mode and shows guidance modal on failure; passes workspace folders +
  `fontDirectories` as bind-mount paths; calls `maybeOpenWalkthrough`
  on activation; registers all the new commands.
- **`src/configurationService.ts`** — getters for the three new
  settings.
- **`src/logger.ts`** — adds the `'Docker'` log category.
- **`.vscodeignore`** — excludes coverage / nyc / Docs / report
  artifacts so the VSIX stays small (310 KB).

### Known limitations

- Large preview canvases (e.g., a 2520×4480 phone-style mock,
  ~11 M pixels) take ~800 ms in docker mode because mesa software
  rendering is the only portable backend. Most samples (small canvas)
  hit the parser-path 100 ms target. See `Docs/Phase5.md` for the
  resolution-cap experiment that was reverted (DALi absolute coords
  don't scale).
- The default `dockerImage` points to
  `ghcr.io/lwc0917/dali-preview-runtime` rather than the dalihub org
  namespace, because dalihub's package-visibility policy currently
  blocks members from making container packages public. Once an org
  admin grants public-package permission, the default will switch
  back to `ghcr.io/dalihub/dali-preview-runtime`.

### Performance (32-core dev machine)

| Path | Cold first render | Warm subsequent |
|---|---|---|
| parser  | 200 ms (incl. shader compile) | 45–150 ms |
| dlopen  | 600 ms                        | 460–594 ms |
| harness | 1.5 s                         | ~1.5 s |

## [0.33.0] - 2026-04-28 — Inspector Read-Only + Multi-Config UX Polish

### Highlights

- Inspector becomes a faithful read-only view of runtime state; the
  source-rewriting property editor is gone. ~1100 LOC removed.
- Multi-config previews finally show all configs reliably and respond
  to UI controls (theme toggle, bg color picker) consistently.
- Inspector finally reports the user's actual color (text color for
  Label, background color for View) instead of the actor tint
  multiplier (which was always white).
- A dedicated diagnostic setting replaces the no-longer-working
  "delete the binary" instruction for measuring the full harness path.

### Added

- **`daliPreview.disablePreviewServer`** boolean setting. When true the
  preview server is never spawned, so every build falls through to the
  full g++ harness path (~1100 ms). Useful for measuring or reproducing
  the slow path. Reflected in the toolbar status as "compile" mode.
- **Inspector color swatch**: color/textColor/backgroundColor properties
  now render as a 12 px swatch + `#RRGGBB` label, with the raw RGBA
  visible in the tooltip.
- **Click-to-code expands the inspector tree**: clicking a bbox in the
  preview unfolds every collapsed ancestor and scrolls the matching
  node into view, instead of silently selecting an invisible node.

### Changed

- **Inspector is now read-only.** The property editor (regex-based
  rewrites of `.SetX(...)` calls in the user's source) is removed
  along with its 600 LOC of tests. Live preview + direct source edit
  is the supported flow; GUI input forms only beat keyboard editing
  for color and opacity, and both were too fragile to keep.
- **Inspector button disables in multi-config and welcome modes** with
  a tooltip explaining why. Inspector relies on per-actor metadata
  that only single-preview produces.
- **Multi-config grid layout** switched from flex-wrap with vertical
  centering (which pushed the 3rd config off-screen on narrow panels)
  to CSS grid with `auto-fit, minmax(220px, 1fr)` and `align-content:
  start`. Each thumbnail capped at 60vh so multi-row layouts fit.
- **Multi-config dimensions label** moved below the canvas to match
  single-preview layout. Name stays above; size sits below using the
  shared `.dimensions-label` style.
- **Theme toggle now applies globally in multi-config.** Once the user
  flips theme via the UI in a session, every config follows that
  choice — including configs that pin `theme=` in `@preview-config`.
  Per-config theme is still honored on initial render so dark/light
  comparison configs default correctly.
- **Theme / bg color rebuild trigger** now resolves the target document
  via `lastDocument` fallback when `vscode.window.activeTextEditor` is
  undefined (the typical case while the webview panel has focus). The
  picker no longer silently no-ops.
- **Active editor switch auto-rebuilds the preview** for the new
  previewable file (single-preview or VNC hot-reload). Switching files
  no longer leaves a stale preview from the previous file.
- **FlexLayout Explorer button** toggles the panel + direction-arrow
  overlay together. It used to flip only the easy-to-miss arrow
  overlay; the panel itself only opened on tree-node selection so
  the button felt unresponsive. Active state stays in sync with
  panel visibility from both entry points.
- **Sample API alignment**: `.Direction()` → `.SetDirection()`,
  `.AlignItems()` → `.SetAlignItems()`, `.JustifyContent()` →
  `.SetJustifyContent()`, `.Wrap()` → `.SetWrap()`,
  `.SetViewPadding()` → `.SetPadding()` across 24 preview samples.
  Several samples no longer compiled against the current API.
- **path3-fullbuild.preview.dali.cpp header** rewritten with
  instructions that actually work (toggle the new
  `disablePreviewServer` setting + Reload Window). The previous "kill
  the process / delete the binary" steps were silently undone within
  hundreds of milliseconds by the extension's auto-respawn and
  auto-rebuild logic, so they no longer measured the slow path.

### Fixed

- **Inspector showed every actor as `#FFFFFF`.** The harness was
  reading `Actor::Property::COLOR`, which is the actor tint multiplier
  (always white by default), not the user-set color. Now reads
  `Label::GetTextColor()` for Label / InputField (emitted as
  `textColor`) and `View::GetBackgroundColor()` for everything else
  (emitted as `backgroundColor`). All four metadata emitters updated:
  `preview_server.cpp`, `preview_harness.cpp.template`,
  `preview_animation.cpp.template`, `preview_interactive.cpp.template`.
- **Preview window kept previous file's huge size.** Opening
  `boarding-pass.preview.dali.cpp` (2520 × 4480) and then a cfg-less
  file used to keep the 2520 × 4480 canvas. Orchestrator now tracks
  the last cfg-supplied width/height and resets to settings defaults
  when the cfg key disappears between files. Webview-driven manual
  resize is preserved when the cfg key is unchanged.
- **Marker-mode multi-config silently failed to update.** When a
  `@dali-preview-begin` file failed to compile, the multi-grid kept
  the previous file's previews intact and only added an error banner
  on top. Saves looked like no-ops. The "keep last good grid on
  all-failed" branch is removed; per-cell error text replaces it.
- **`TextLabel::New(...)` in `multi-config-marker.cpp`** never built
  because `Dali::Toolkit::TextLabel` is not in scope (the plugin
  template links only dali-ui-foundation, not dali-toolkit). Replaced
  with `Label::New(...)` which is in `Dali::Ui`.
- **`gallery.preview.dali.cpp`** had `.Wrap(FlexWrap::WRAP)` which
  doesn't exist on `FlexLayout`. Renamed to `.SetWrap(...)`.

### Removed

- **`src/propertyEditor.ts`** (254 LOC) and
  **`test/unit/propertyEditor.test.ts`** (605 LOC). See "Inspector is
  now read-only" above.

## [0.32.1] - 2026-04-17 — First-Preview Image Fix

### Fixed

- **Preview server: images missing on first preview**: The preview server captured screenshots immediately after building the scene, before asynchronous image decoding completed. Images only appeared on subsequent previews due to DALi's internal texture cache. Added `AreAllResourcesReady()` polling (min 300ms, up to 3s timeout) to `DoReload()` and `DoRenderJson()` — matching the existing harness template behavior.

### Changed

- **Animation sample simplified**: Removed unnecessary FlexLayout wrapper, increased animation duration to 3s and travel distance to 200px for clearer visual feedback.

## [0.32.0] - 2026-04-17 — Mid-Project Stability Overhaul

### Added

- **PreviewOrchestrator** (`src/previewOrchestrator.ts`): Extracted all preview pipeline logic from `extension.ts` into a dedicated orchestrator class. Reduces `extension.ts` from ~1,237 lines to ~612 lines, making it testable and maintainable.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Three build strategies (`ParserStrategy`, `DlopenStrategy`, `HarnessStrategy`) replace the monolithic `runPreview()` switch logic, enabling clean addition of future rendering backends.
- **95 new tests** (414 → 509): `xvfbManager.test.ts` (26), `previewCodeLens.test.ts` (32), `integration.test.ts` (36 — including 7 P0 pipeline scenarios).
- **c8 coverage reporting**: V8-native code coverage with HTML reports (`npm run coverage`).
- **`server/check-harness-compiles.sh`**: CI script that syntax-checks all C++ harness templates, preventing v0.15.x-style include path regressions.

### Changed

- **Error messages unified to English**: All user-facing strings across 6 source files and `preview.html` translated from Korean to English for marketplace consistency.
- **`package.json` OS restriction**: Added `"os": ["linux"]` to prevent installation on unsupported platforms.
- **CI hardened**: `npm audit --audit-level=moderate` added to ci.yml, release.yml; harness template compilation check added to golden-test.yml.
- **Coverage tooling**: Switched from nyc to c8 (V8-native) for compatibility with the vscode module mock.

### Fixed

- **statusBar test**: Updated assertions to match English tooltip text after i18n unification.

## [0.31.0] - 2026-04-16 — 구조화 로거 통합 + FlexLayout Explorer 안정화

### Added

- **구조화 로거 (`src/logger.ts`)**: LogLevel(ERROR/WARN/INFO/DEBUG/TRACE) + LogCategory(Extraction/Build/Execute/Render/FlexLayout 등) 기반 카테고리별 필터링 지원. VS Code output channel에 구조화된 포맷으로 출력
- **ConfigurationService**: `daliPreview.*` 설정을 중앙화된 싱글턴으로 읽기. 설정 변경 즉시 반영
- **공유 타입 (`src/types.ts`)**: BuildResult 등 중복 정의 인터페이스 통합

### Changed

- **FlexLayout 메타데이터 보강 경로**: 메타데이터 읽기 실패 시 `log.trace` 로 정확한 오류 추적 가능
- **전체 모듈 로거 통합**: buildRunner, codeExtractor, extension, previewManager, previewServer, vncManager, xvfbManager, sdbManager 등 모든 주요 모듈에 구조화 로거 적용
- **buildRunner**: workspace별 임시 디렉토리 (`/tmp/dali_preview_<hash>`) 사용으로 멀티윈도우 충돌 방지
- **CI**: 보안 감사 단계(`npm audit`) 추가

### Fixed

- **하네스 골든 파일**: `AreAllResourcesReady()` 함수 + `mTickCount` 멤버 반영 — `harnessGeneration` 테스트 1건 통과 복구

## [0.30.0] - 2026-04-16 — VNC 인터랙티브 모드 안정화 + ImageView 프리뷰 수정

### Fixed

- **VNC RFB 버퍼 동기화 오류**: `_handleFBUpdate()`에서 불완전 데이터 소비 후 남은 바이트가 메시지 타입으로 잘못 해석되던 문제 수정 (peek-then-consume 패턴 적용)
- **VNC 캔버스 크기 불일치**: VNC 전용 Xvfb(4096x4096)를 별도 시작하고, DALi가 보고하는 실제 윈도우 크기로 x11vnc `-clip` 적용
- **VNC 핫리로드 시 VNC 인프라 파괴**: `restartDaliApp()` 중 이전 DALi 프로세스 exit 핸들러가 x11vnc/websockify/Xvfb를 전부 정리하던 문제 수정 (`_restarting` 플래그)
- **VNC 핫리로드 디스플레이 불일치**: `restartDaliApp()`이 메인 Xvfb 대신 VNC 전용 디스플레이를 사용하도록 수정
- **VNC 모드에서 `@preview-config` width/height 미적용**: `startVncMode()`과 `hotReloadVnc()`에서 config 파싱 추가
- **VNC 모드 전환 시 캔버스 중복**: `RFB.disconnect()`에서 canvas를 DOM에서 제거하도록 수정
- **ImageView 정적 프리뷰 미출력**: preview_server의 scene assembler가 `ImageView`를 `View::New()`로 대체하던 문제 수정. `ImageView::New(url)` 분기 추가
- **이미지 리소스 로딩 전 캡처**: preview_harness에서 `View::IsResourceReady()` 폴링 도입 (100ms 간격, 최대 3초 대기)

### Added

- **VNC 마우스/키보드 이벤트 포워딩**: rfb.js에 mousedown/up/move/wheel → `sendPointerEvent`, keydown/up → `sendKey` (X11 keysym 변환) 추가
- **SetColourMapEntries 핸들러**: RFB 메시지 타입 1 처리 추가
- **VNC 의존성 Setup Wizard 통합**: `x11vnc`, `websockify`를 `installMissingDependencies()`에 추가
- **VNC 전용 Xvfb 관리**: `VncManager`에 별도 Xvfb(`:96/:95/:94`) 시작/정리 로직 추가
- **DALi 실제 윈도우 크기 보고**: interactive 템플릿이 `READY <width> <height>` 출력, VncManager가 파싱하여 x11vnc clip에 반영

## [0.29.0] - 2026-04-16 — 10개 쇼케이스 샘플 + instrumentCode 안정성 + 프리뷰 UX 개선

### Added

- **10개 프로덕션 급 쇼케이스 샘플**: Music Player, Weather Forecast, Fitness Dashboard, Food Delivery, Boarding Pass, Crypto Portfolio, Smart Home, 그리고 Flow Banking 앱 프로젝트(Home/Card/Transfer 3화면). 실제 이미지, 그라디언트, rounded corners, markup 텍스트, bar chart, 바코드 등 DALi UI Foundation의 다양한 기능을 시연.
- **`test/samples/assets/`**: 쇼케이스 샘플용 이미지 자산 13개 (portrait, food, interior, album art).
- **`test/samples/flow-banking/`**: 동일 브랜드(teal `#00d4a8`) 컨셉의 3화면 뱅킹 앱 프로젝트. 프로젝트 내 UI Preview 시연 목적.

### Fixed

- **`instrumentCode()` 문자열 내 `)` 처리**: 기존 regex `[^)]*`가 `Label::New(")")` 같은 문자열 안의 `)` 를 함수 닫는 괄호로 오인하여 `__tag()` 래핑이 깨지는 버그 수정. balanced-parenthesis walker로 교체하여 문자열 리터럴과 중첩 괄호를 정확히 처리.
- **`@preview-config` 파일의 click-to-code 라인 오프셋**: `.preview.dali.cpp` 파일에서 `@preview-config` 줄을 제거한 뒤 `startLine: 0` 으로 고정하여 라인 번호가 config 줄 수만큼 밀리던 문제. `startLine: configLineCount`로 수정.
- **`validateDaliPrefix()` 강화**: `libdali2-core.so` 만 확인하던 것에 `dali2-ui-foundation.pc` 존재도 검증. 여러 DALi 설치가 있을 때 `Dali::Ui::View` 없는 구버전이 선택되는 문제 방지.
- **단일 `@preview-config` 인스펙터 지원**: config가 1개일 때 multi-preview 대신 single-preview 경로로 라우팅하여 위젯 인스펙터와 click-to-code 오버레이가 정상 동작.
- **Multi-preview 에러 시 이전 이미지 유지**: 빌드 전체 실패 시 이전 성공 렌더를 보존하고 에러 배너만 오버레이.

### Improved

- **프리뷰 그리드 가운데 정렬**: multi-preview 이미지가 패널 중앙에 표시. `max-height`도 `60vh`에서 `calc(100vh - 90px)`로 확대.
- **인스펙터 트리 텍스트 확대**: `.tree-node` 12→14px, toggle 9→11px, name 11→13px.
- **에러 메시지 복사 가능**: `.preview-grid-error`에 `user-select: text` 추가.

## [0.28.0] - 2026-04-16 — Parser-first 클릭-투-코드 호환 + 애니메이션 컴파일 수정 + 임시 파일 정리

### Fixed

- **클릭-투-코드 회귀 수정** (v0.23.0부터): Phase 4-2 parser-first 경로가 `instrumentCode()`를 건너뛰면서 scene JSON에 `__L` 라인 태그가 없어 프리뷰 클릭 / 위젯 인스펙터 양방향 하이라이트가 모두 실패. `parseChainExpression`이 토큰 라인을 추적해 `SceneNode.sourceLine`에 기록하고, C++ 서버가 이를 읽어 `Actor::Property::NAME = "__L{line}"`으로 태깅하도록 전 파이프라인 정비.
- **애니메이션 샘플 컴파일 에러**: `instrumentCode`가 `Animation::New()`, `Timer::New()`, `Capture::New()` 등 non-Actor 핸들까지 `__tag()`로 래핑하면서 `SetProperty(Actor::Property::NAME, ...)` 호출이 컴파일 실패 (`‘class Dali::Animation’ has no member named ‘SetProperty’`). Actor 파생 타입 allowlist(15개) 도입으로 해결.
- **Stale preview_server 바이너리**: IPC 프로토콜을 변경한 릴리즈 업데이트 후에도 `/tmp/dali_preview/preview_server`가 구버전 그대로 캐시되어 구 프로토콜을 내보내면서 RENDER_JSON 응답 파싱 실패 → 프리뷰 무응답. `ensureServerBinary()`가 소스 파일 mtime을 바이너리와 비교해 소스가 더 새로우면 자동 재빌드.

### Added

- **`src/cppParser.ts`**: 토크나이저가 토큰별 1-based `line` 번호 추적. `SceneNode`에 `sourceLine?: number` 필드 추가. `parseChainExpression(code, startLine?)` 시그니처로 절대 라인 오프셋 전달, 각 `::New()` 노드에 `(tokenLine - 1) + startLine` 값 주입. LRU 캐시 키도 `startLine:code` 복합 키로 확장.
- **`server/preview_server.cpp`**: `SceneNodeJson`에 `int sourceLine = -1` 필드 + `JReadNumber` 헬퍼 + `JParseNode`의 `sourceLine` 키 처리. `SBBuildNode` 래퍼가 `SBBuildNodeRaw` 결과를 `__L{sourceLine}`로 태깅. 재귀 호출도 자동으로 같은 래퍼 경유해 자식 노드까지 일괄 태깅.
- **`src/buildRunner.ts`**: `cleanupBuildTmpDir(tmpDir)` 순수 함수 export. `dispose()`가 extension 종료 시 `/tmp/dali_preview/`의 플러그인 `.so`/`.cpp`, 렌더 PNG, metadata JSON, `anim_frames/` 등 모든 임시 아티팩트를 제거. `preview_server` 바이너리는 재빌드 비용 회피 및 위 mtime 체크 로직으로 staleness가 해소되므로 보존.
- **`src/previewServer.ts`**: `ensureServerBinary()`가 mtime 비교로 자동 재빌드. "Source newer than binary — rebuilding to avoid IPC protocol drift." 로그.
- **`test/e2e/click_to_code_e2e.py`**: 독립 실행형 릴리즈 회귀 테스트. Xvfb 자동 기동 + preview_server 스폰 후 두 경로 검증 — **Path A** (RELOAD): `__tag()` 래핑 plugin 컴파일 + RELOAD, **Path B** (RENDER_JSON): `sourceLine` 필드가 든 scene JSON 직접 기입. 메타데이터 JSON의 `__L` 태그 개수로 검증.
- **`package.json` 스크립트**: `npm run test:click-to-code` (e2e 단독) 및 `npm run test:release` (`test:unit` + `test:click-to-code`, 릴리즈 게이트).
- **단위 테스트 확장**:
  - `test/unit/codeExtractor.test.ts`: Actor allowlist 동작 6건 (FlexLayout / View / TextLabel / ImageView / ScrollView / Control 래핑, Animation / Timer / Capture 미래핑, mixed 스니펫).
  - `test/unit/cleanupBuildTmpDir.test.ts` (신규): cleanup 로직 5건 — preview_server 보존, 재귀 디렉토리 삭제, 다수 파일 일괄 정리, 없는/빈 디렉토리 처리.

### Changed

- **`src/extension.ts`**: Phase 4-2 parser-first 경로 재활성화, `parseChainExpression`에 `extraction.startLine` 전달. parser-first 성능 이득(~200ms 절감)과 click-to-code 호환 양립.

### Tests

- 단위 테스트 415건 통과 (+11 신규: allowlist 6 + cleanup 5)
- E2E click-to-code Path A + Path B 모두 통과
- 애니메이션 샘플 실제 컴파일 + Xvfb 실행 검증: 20/20 프레임 캡처

- **GitHub Actions 워크플로우** (`.github/workflows/golden-test.yml`): self-hosted runner에서 골든 테스트 실행. concurrency 제어, job timeout(20분), Xvfb xdpyinfo 폴링 대기, DALi SDK pre-flight 검증, /tmp 정리, 실패 시 diff + actual 아티팩트 업로드(14일 보존).
- **`package.json` 스크립트**: `test:e2e` (회귀 비교), `test:golden:update` (골든 파일 갱신).
- **골든 이미지 디렉토리** (`test/golden/screenshots/`): 기준 PNG 저장 위치.
- **`.gitignore`**: `test/e2e/actual/`, `test/e2e/diff/` 추가.
- **의존성**: `pixelmatch ^7.1.0`, `pngjs ^7.0.0`, `@types/pngjs ^6.0.5` 추가.

---

## [0.26.0] - 2026-04-10 — CodeLens Preview + // @preview 단일 마커 지원

### Added
- **`src/previewCodeLens.ts`** (신규): `PreviewCodeLensProvider` 구현. C++ 파일에서 DALi View를 반환하는 함수(`CreatePreview`, `BuildScene`, `@preview` 주석 표시 함수) 위에 `▶ Preview` 버튼 자동 표시. `provideCodeLenses()`는 함수 반환 타입 패턴(View/FlexLayout/StackLayout 등) 감지.
- **`src/codeExtractor.ts`**: `// @preview` 단일 마커 지원 추가 — 마커가 있는 줄부터 해당 함수 바디 끝까지를 프리뷰 코드로 추출. `extractFunctionBody(doc, startLine, endLine)` 함수 추가 — CodeLens에서 선택한 함수 범위를 직접 추출.
- **`src/extension.ts`**: `dali.previewFunction` 커맨드 등록 — CodeLens에서 호출. `lastCodeLensFunc` 상태로 라이브 프리뷰 시 마지막 CodeLens 대상 유지. `preExtracted` 파라미터로 `runPreview()`에 추출 결과 직접 전달.
- **`package.json`**: `dali.previewFunction` 커맨드 등록.
- **`test/samples/codelens-example.cpp`** (신규): CodeLens 시나리오용 샘플 — `CreatePreview()`, `BuildCard()` 등 View-returning 함수 포함.
- **`test/samples/single-marker.cpp`** (신규): `// @preview` 단일 마커 시나리오 샘플.
- **`test/samples/path1-parser.preview.dali.cpp`** (신규): 파서 경로 테스트용 샘플 (FlexLayout chain).

- **`test/samples/marker-example.cpp`**: `// @preview` 단일 마커 예시 포함하도록 업데이트.
- **`.vscode/launch.json`**: 디버그 실행 시 `test/samples` 폴더를 워크스페이스로 자동 오픈 — CodeLens 미리보기 수동 테스트 편의.

## [0.25.0] - 2026-04-10 — 성능 계측 로그 추가 + Debounce 범위 조정

### Added
- **`src/extension.ts`**: `[Perf]` 타이밍 로그 추가 — `T2 runPreview start`, `extract+instrument`, `previewServer 상태`, `parse`, `renderJson`, `compilePlugin`, `server.reload`, `buildAndRun`, `metadata read+enrich`, `T5 postMessage sent` 각 단계의 소요 시간 출력. 전체 파이프라인 지연(텍스트 변경 → 업데이트) 계측 가능.
- **`src/extension.ts`**: `lastTextChangeTime` 변수 추가 — 텍스트 변경 시각 기록, 디바운스 발화(`T1`) 및 T5 시점과의 elapsed time 계산에 활용.
- **`src/extension.ts`**: `[LivePreview] Debouncer created` 및 설정 변경 로그 추가.

### Changed
- **`package.json`**: `daliPreview.livePreviewDebounce` 범위 100~5000ms → 0~3000ms 변경. 0ms 설정 시 즉시 트리거 가능.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-04-10 — 렌더 캡처 최적화

### Changed
- **`server/preview_server.cpp`**: `Timer::New(200)` 제거 — 캡처 지연 타이머 대신 `OnStartCapture()` 직접 호출. DALi Capture API가 내부적으로 `RenderTask(REFRESH_ONCE)`를 사용하여 레이아웃 패스 완료 후 캡처를 스케줄링하므로 별도 지연 불필요.
- **`src/previewServer.ts`**: `renderJson()` 완료 후 임시 scene JSON 파일(`/tmp/*.scene.json`) 자동 정리 (`fs.promises.unlink`) — 디스크 공간 누수 방지.

## [0.23.0] - 2026-04-10 — Preview Server IPC 안정화

### Added
- **`src/propertyEditor.ts`**: `PropertyEditor` 클래스에 `INSERT` 모드 지원 추가 — 속성 삽입 위치를 정밀하게 제어. `EditResult` 타입 개선으로 실패 원인 반환.
- **`media/preview.html`**: 인스펙터 UI 개선:
  - 레이아웃 정책 드롭다운 (`SetRequestedWidth` / `SetRequestedHeight`) — MATCH_PARENT / WRAP_CONTENT / 숫자 값 선택 가능.
  - `__L` 접두사 속성 숨김 처리 (내부 레이아웃 힌트 표시 제거).
  - 노드 재선택 후에도 인스펙터 선택 상태 유지 (선택 보존 로직).
  - 치수 행(dimension row) 추가 — 너비/높이를 한 행에 표시.

### Changed
- **`server/preview_server.cpp`**: `SBParseLayoutLength()` → `SBParseDimension()` 대체. MATCH_PARENT=-2.0f, WRAP_CONTENT=-1.0f 반환하도록 변경 (DALi-UI-Foundation API 호환성 개선).
- **`server/preview_server.cpp`**: `FontClient::Get()` → `Dali::TextAbstraction::FontClient::Get()` 전체 네임스페이스 명시 (링커 충돌 방지).
- **`src/flexMetadata.ts`**: FlexLayout 파서 데이터 병합 로직 개선.
- **`test/helpers/setup.ts`**: 테스트 헬퍼 설정 업데이트.

## [0.21.0] - 2026-04-06 — Phase 4-5: FlexLayout Explorer (레이아웃 시각화 도구) — DAL-35

### Added

- **`src/flexMetadata.ts`** (신규): `enrichMetadataWithFlexProps()` 유틸리티. TypeScript 파서 트리(SceneNode)에서 `Direction`/`AlignItems`/`JustifyContent`/`Wrap` 속성을 추출하여 런타임 메타데이터 노드에 `flexProps` 키로 주입. DFS 순서로 트리를 매칭하며, 자식 수 불일치 시 graceful degradation.
- **`src/extension.ts`**: 파서 패스 성공 시 `parserScene` 보존 → 메타데이터 로드 후 `enrichMetadataWithFlexProps()` 호출하여 FlexLayout 속성 병합.
- **`media/preview.html`**: FlexLayout Explorer 기능 추가:
  - Inspector 패널 하단에 "FlexLayout Explorer" 섹션 — FlexLayout 노드 선택 시 direction/alignItems/justifyContent/wrap 표시 (direction은 화살표 아이콘 시각화: →↓←↑).
  - 툴바에 ◆ 토글 버튼 추가 — FlexLayout 노드가 씬에 있을 때만 표시.
  - 토글 활성화 시 프리뷰 이미지 위에 방향 화살표 + `flex direction` 레이블 오버레이 렌더링.
- **`server/preview_harness.cpp.template`**: `CollectActorMetadata()`에 FlexLayout 런타임 속성 추출 추가 — `FlexDirection`/`FlexAlign`/`FlexJustify`/`FlexWrap` enum → 문자열 변환 헬퍼 함수, `FlexLayout::DownCast()` + getter 호출, `flexProps` JSON 키 출력.
- **`server/preview_server.cpp`**: 동일한 FlexLayout 메타데이터 추출 적용 (RENDER_JSON 경로).
- **`test/unit/flexMetadata.test.ts`** (신규): 8개 테스트 — null scene, FlexLayout 주입, enum 정규화, 비-FlexLayout 스킵, 중첩 병합, 기본값 제공, 자식 수 불일치, 빈 루트 처리.
- **`test/samples/flex-explorer.preview.dali.cpp`** (신규): FlexLayout Explorer 기능 확인용 샘플 파일.

### Changed

- **`test/golden/red-box.harness.cpp`**: 하네스 템플릿에 FlexLayout 헬퍼 함수 추가 반영하여 재생성.

## [0.20.0] - 2026-04-03 — Phase 4-4: Tizen 실기기 프리뷰 (SDB 배포 + 스크린샷 캡처) — DAL-34

### Added

- **`src/sdbManager.ts`** (신규): `SdbManager` 클래스 구현. `checkDependencies()` (sdb 설치 여부 확인), `getDevices()` + `parseDevices()` (sdb devices 파싱), `selectDevice()` (QuickPick UI로 디바이스 선택), `push()`, `pull()`, `shell()`, `forward()`, `removeForward()` 메서드 제공.
- **`src/buildRunner.ts`**: `buildAndRunOnDevice()` 메서드 추가. 파이프라인: 하네스 생성 → 로컬 컴파일(크로스 컴파일 지원) → `sdb push` 바이너리 → `sdb shell` 실행 → `sdb pull` PNG + 메타데이터. `compileCrossDevice()` private 메서드 추가 (arm-linux-gnueabi-g++ + sysroot 기반 pkg-config). `SdbManager` import 추가.
- **`src/extension.ts`**: `sdbManager` 인스턴스 추가 및 라이프사이클 관리. `dali.selectDevice` 커맨드 (디바이스 선택 → workspace state 저장). `dali.devicePreview` 커맨드 (SDB 없으면 에러 안내). `runDevicePreview()` 함수 구현. `deactivate()`에 `sdbManager.dispose()` 추가.
- **`src/statusBar.ts`**: `showMode()` 타입에 `'device'` 모드 추가 (`📱 Device` 레이블).
- **`package.json`**: `dali.selectDevice`, `dali.devicePreview` 커맨드 등록. `daliPreview.sdbPath`, `daliPreview.tizenSysroot`, `daliPreview.targetDevice` 설정 추가.
- **`test/unit/sdbManager.test.ts`** (신규): `checkDependencies()` 3케이스, `parseDevices()` 5케이스 (단일 디바이스, 다중 디바이스, 빈 출력, 헤더 스킵, offline 상태), `dispose()` 1케이스.
- **`test/unit/buildRunner.device.test.ts`** (신규): `buildAndRunOnDevice()` 6케이스 — sdb push 실패, 디바이스 출력 `OK:` 없음, sdb pull 실패, 성공 경로(pngPath 확인), 크로스 컴파일 실패 전파, compile 실패 시 sdb 미호출.

### Fixed

- **[보안] `src/sdbManager.ts`**: `checkDependencies()`에서 `execSync`를 `spawnSync`로 교체하여 셸 인젝션 방지 (sdbPath 사용자 입력값이 셸을 경유하지 않음).
- **[보안] `src/buildRunner.ts`**: `compileCrossDevice()`의 `sysroot` 이스케이프 강화 — `"`, 백틱, `$` 모두 이스케이프하여 악성 workspace 설정값 주입 차단.
- **[버그] `src/extension.ts`**: `currentDeviceSerial` 복원을 `context.workspaceState.get` → `vscode.workspace.getConfiguration('daliPreview').get('targetDevice')` 로 변경하여 저장/읽기 스토리지 일치.
- **[버그] `src/sdbManager.ts`**: `getDevices()`의 `.catch()` 체인 및 dead code 제거 — `exec(['devices'])` 단일 호출로 단순화. CLAUDE.md 스타일 규칙(`no raw .catch() chains`) 준수.
- **[버그] `src/statusBar.ts`**: `showMode()` 첫 줄에 `clearRevertTimer()` 추가 — 진행 중인 revert 타이머가 device 모드 상태를 덮어쓰는 race condition 수정.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-04-03 — Phase 4-3: 애니메이션 프리뷰 (GIF 연속 캡처 + 타임라인 스크러빙) — DAL-31

### Added

- **`src/previewConfig.ts`**: `PreviewConfig`에 `animation`, `duration`, `fps` 필드 추가. `MultiPreviewResult`에 `gifPath`, `frameCount` 추가.
- **`src/codeExtractor.ts`**: `@preview-config`에서 `animation=true/false`, `duration=N` (500~10000ms), `fps=N` (5~30) 파라미터 파싱. 범위 외 값은 조용히 무시.
- **`server/preview_animation.cpp.template`** (신규): 멀티프레임 연속 캡처 C++ 하네스. 레이아웃 안정화 500ms 대기 → `FRAME:N/TOTAL` 프로토콜 출력 → `ANIM_DONE:N` + 메타데이터 내보내기. 프레임 캡처 실패 시 해당 프레임 스킵 후 계속.
- **`src/buildRunner.ts`**: `AnimationBuildResult` 인터페이스 추가. `buildAndRunAnimation()` 메서드: 하네스 생성 → g++ 컴파일 → 실행 → ffmpeg `palettegen+paletteuse` 필터로 고품질 GIF 합성. `ffmpegAvailable()` 런타임 감지, 미설치 시 첫 프레임 PNG 폴백.
- **`src/previewManager.ts`**: `updateAnimation(gifOrPngPath, buildTimeMs, frameCount, metadata)` 메서드 추가. `onAnimationSpeedChange()` 콜백 시스템 추가. `handleMessage`에 `animationSpeedChange` case 추가.
- **`media/preview.html`**: 애니메이션 재생 UI 추가. GIF 표시 컨테이너 (`animationContainer`), 재생/일시정지 버튼, 처음부터 버튼, 속도 슬라이더 (0.25x~3x, 500ms 디바운싱). `updateAnimation` 메시지 핸들러. `updateImage` 수신 시 애니메이션 컨테이너 숨김 처리.
- **`src/extension.ts`**: `runAnimationPreview()` 헬퍼 추가. `runPreview()`에서 `animation=true` config 감지 시 애니메이션 경로로 분기.
- **`test/unit/codeExtractor.test.ts`**: 애니메이션 config 파싱 테스트 11건 추가 (범위 검증 포함).
- **`test/samples/animation.preview.dali.cpp`** (신규): DALi Animation API를 사용하는 애니메이션 프리뷰 샘플.

### Fixed

- **`server/preview_animation.cpp.template`**: `TriggerNextFrame()` 재진입 시 이전 `FinishedSignal().Disconnect()` 추가 → mFrameIndex 중복 증가 위험 제거.
- **`server/preview_animation.cpp.template`**: `ExportSceneMetadata` 호출 위치를 첫 프레임 캡처 직후(`mFrameIndex == 1`)로 이동 → Click-to-Code 좌표가 초기 레이아웃 기준으로 수집됨.
- **`src/buildRunner.ts`**: `executeAnimation` maxBuffer 50MB 명시 → 300+ 프레임 stdout 오버플로 방지.
- **`src/buildRunner.ts`**: `ffmpegAvailable()` 정적 캐시 추가 → 매 빌드마다 `which ffmpeg` 서브프로세스 재호출 제거.
- **`src/buildRunner.ts`**: `buildAndRunAnimation()` `displayPath` 빈 문자열 가드 추가.
- **`src/buildRunner.ts`**: `animConfig.duration ?? 2000` → 0값 오처리 방지.
- **`src/extension.ts`**: `runAnimationPreview()` 오류 경로에서 `startLine` 하드코딩(0) → `extraction.startLine` 올바르게 전달 (마커 모드 에러 라인 오프셋 버그 수정).

### Design

## [0.16.0] - 2026-04-02 — 프로젝트 안정화 — DAL-28

### Fixed

- **preview_interactive 템플릿 font-client.h 경로 수정** (`server/preview_interactive.cpp.template`): DAL-23에서 `preview_harness`·`preview_server`의 경로를 수정했으나 `preview_interactive.cpp.template`가 누락됨. `dali/devel-api/adaptor-framework/font-client.h` → `dali/devel-api/text-abstraction/font-client.h`로 통일.

### Added

- **시작 시 환경 검증 강화** (`src/daliEnvironment.ts`, `src/extension.ts`): 확장 활성화 시 `validateEnvironment()`로 g++, pkg-config, Xvfb, DALi SDK 유무를 사전 체크. 누락된 의존성은 `outputChannel`에 구체적인 설치 명령(`apt-get install ...`)과 함께 기록되고 VS Code 경고 알림으로 표시됨.
- **에러 메시지 UX 개선** (`src/errorParser.ts`, `src/extension.ts`): `formatRawError()` 함수 추가. `parseGccErrors()`가 사용자 코드 에러를 찾지 못할 때 raw g++ 출력 대신 첫 번째 의미 있는 오류 줄을 `"Line N, Col M: ..."` 형식으로 변환해 표시.
- **하니스 컴파일 통합 테스트 스크립트** (`scripts/check-harness-compiles.sh`): DALi SDK 환경에서 세 개 C++ 하니스 템플릿(`preview_harness`, `preview_interactive`, `preview_plugin`)을 실제 g++로 컴파일해 include 경로·타입 오류를 CI 단계에서 조기 발견.

### Tests

- `test/unit/errorParser.test.ts`: `formatRawError()` 케이스 5개 추가.
- `test/unit/daliEnvironment.test.ts`: `validateEnvironment()` 케이스 6개 신규 추가 (의존성 주입으로 실제 셸 명령 없이 테스트).

### Fixed (QA 리뷰)

- **g++ 체크 버그 수정** (`src/daliEnvironment.ts`): `checkDependencies()`에서 `gcc` 대신 `g++`를 체크하도록 수정.
- **불필요한 동적 import 제거** (`src/extension.ts`): `findDaliPrefix`를 정적 import로 변경.
- **Raw `.then()` 제거** (`src/extension.ts`): `showWarningMessage` 호출을 `await`로 변환.
- **Shell 스크립트 symlink 감지 수정** (`scripts/check-harness-compiles.sh`): `-f` → `-e`로 변경.

## [0.15.3] - 2026-04-02 — 버그픽스: Dali::String.CStr() 완전 수정 — DAL-26

### Fixed

- **Dali::String.CStr() 변환** (`server/preview_harness.cpp.template`, `server/preview_server.cpp`, `server/preview_interactive.cpp.template`, `test/golden/red-box.harness.cpp`): DAL-25 수정이 불완전 — `std::string(actor.GetTypeName())`은 `std::string` 생성자가 `Dali::String`을 받을 수 없어 동일 에러 재발. `.CStr()` 메서드로 `const char*` 변환 후 `std::string` 생성: `std::string(actor.GetTypeName().CStr())`.

---

## [0.15.2] - 2026-04-02 — 버그픽스: Dali::String → std::string 타입 불일치 수정 — DAL-25

### Fixed

- **Dali::String 명시적 변환** (`server/preview_harness.cpp.template`, `server/preview_server.cpp`, `server/preview_interactive.cpp.template`): `actor.GetTypeName()`이 반환하는 `Dali::String`을 `ShortTypeName(const std::string&)` 에 전달할 때 발생하는 타입 불일치 에러 수정. `std::string(actor.GetTypeName())`으로 명시적 변환 추가.

---

## [0.15.1] - 2026-04-02 — 버그픽스: font-client.h 경로 수정 — DAL-23

### Fixed

- **font-client.h 경로 수정** (`server/preview_harness.cpp.template`, `server/preview_server.cpp`): `dali/devel-api/adaptor-framework/font-client.h`는 존재하지 않는 경로. 실제 위치인 `dali/devel-api/text-abstraction/font-client.h`로 수정. 이 버그로 인해 익스텐션 실행 시 항상 컴파일 에러가 발생하여 프리뷰가 불가능했음.

---

## [0.15.0] - 2026-04-02 — Phase 4-1: 인터랙티브 모드 (VNC) — DAL-22

### Added

- **VncManager** (`src/vncManager.ts`): x11vnc + websockify + DALi 앱 프로세스 생명주기 관리. 포트 자동 탐색 (5900-5910, 6080-6090), graceful shutdown, hot reload 지원.

- **dali.toggleInteractiveMode 명령** (`src/extension.ts`): VNC 모드 시작/중지, 파일 저장 시 핫 리로드, 의존성 체크 후 툴바 버튼 노출.
- **StatusBarManager.showMode('vnc')** (`src/statusBar.ts`): VNC 모드 상태 표시.
- **설정 추가** (`package.json`): `daliPreview.vncPort` (기본 5900), `daliPreview.websocketPort` (기본 6080).

### Tests

- `test/unit/vncManager.test.ts` 신규: checkDependencies, findAvailablePort, isRunning, startInteractiveMode 의존성 오류 처리 테스트.
- 테스트 총계: **236개** (이전 228개 → +8)

### Fixed

- **C1 SetPositionX/Y 우선** (`src/propertyEditor.ts`): x/y 속성 편집 시 `SetPositionX(float)` / `SetPositionY(float)`을 1순위 매처로 추가. 기존 `SetPosition(x, y)` 2인수 패턴은 fallback으로 유지.
- **C2 UiColor 형식 지원** (`media/preview.html`, `src/propertyEditor.ts`): 색상 피커 출력을 `Vector4(...)` → `UiColor(0xRRGGBB)` 로 변경 (DALi 샘플 코드 스타일과 동일). color validator가 `UiColor(0x...)` 형식을 허용하도록 갱신.
- **H1 SetProperty(VISIBLE) 우선** (`src/propertyEditor.ts`): visible 속성 편집 시 `SetProperty(Actor::Property::VISIBLE, bool)` 공개 API를 1순위로, `SetVisible()` 내부 API는 fallback으로 변경.
- **H2 NaN sourceLine 방어** (`src/previewManager.ts`): `typeof n === 'number'`는 NaN도 통과하므로 `Number.isInteger(sourceLine)` 검증 추가.
- **H3 propName allowlist 검증** (`src/previewManager.ts`): `EDITABLE_PROPS.includes(propName)` 검사 추가로 미등록 속성명 전달 차단.
- **H4 색상 피커 디바운싱** (`media/preview.html`): `<input type="color">` change 핸들러에 100ms 디바운스 추가. 드래그 중 연속 postMessage 방지.

### Tests

### Added

- **`src/propertyEditor.ts` 신규**: `PropertyEditor` 클래스. Inspector 속성 패널에서 편집된 값을 소스코드에 자동 반영. `vscode.workspace.applyEdit` 사용으로 VS Code undo/redo 완전 지원.
- **편집 가능한 속성 패널** (`media/preview.html`): `__L<line>` 태그가 있는 Actor(소스 라인 매핑 가능)의 속성을 직접 편집.
  - `x`, `y`, `w`, `h` → `<input type="number">` 숫자 입력
  - `opacity` → 슬라이더 (0.0 ~ 1.0)
  - `visible` → 체크박스 토글
  - `color` → `<input type="color">` 색상 피커 (hex → `Vector4` 변환 자동)
- **소스 매핑 불가 속성 시각적 구분** (`media/preview.html`): `__L<line>` 태그 없는 Actor 속성은 이탤릭 회색(`readonly`) 스타일로 읽기 전용 표시.
- **`PreviewManager.onEditProperty()`** (`src/previewManager.ts`): Webview `editProperty` 메시지를 Extension으로 전달하는 콜백 등록 API.
- **Extension 연결** (`src/extension.ts`): `PropertyEditor` 인스턴스 생성 및 `onEditProperty` 이벤트 수신. 편집 실패 시 `outputChannel` 로깅 + `showWarningMessage`.
- **`workspace.applyEdit` + `WorkspaceEdit` mock** (`test/helpers/setup.ts`): PropertyEditor 단위 테스트를 위한 vscode mock 확장.
- **단위 테스트** (`test/unit/propertyEditor.test.ts`): PropertyEditor 21개 + PreviewManager.onEditProperty 3개 — 총 **24개 테스트** 신규 추가. 누적 214개.

### Changed

- **속성 패널 CSS 확장** (`media/preview.html`): `.prop-input`, `.prop-opacity-wrap`, `.readonly` 등 편집 위젯 스타일 추가.

---

## [0.12.0] - 2026-04-01 — Phase 3-2: 위젯 트리 Inspector (DAL-16)

### Fixed (QA 리뷰)

- **JsonEscapeStr 제어문자 누락** (`server/preview_harness.cpp.template`, `server/preview_server.cpp`): RFC 8259 §7 미준수 — 0x00–0x1F 범위 제어문자를 `\uXXXX` 포맷으로 이스케이프하지 않던 버그 수정. Actor 이름에 제어문자 포함 시 Webview JSON 파싱 오류 가능성 제거.
- **NaN/Inf 미검증** (`server/preview_harness.cpp.template`, `server/preview_server.cpp`): `opacity`·`color` RGBA 컴포넌트에 `std::isfinite()` 가드 추가. 미초기화 Actor 속성에서 비정상 float 출력 시 JSON 파싱 실패 방지.
- **color 포맷 비표준** (`server/preview_harness.cpp.template`, `server/preview_server.cpp`): `"color":"r,g,b,a"` (문자열) → `"color":[r,g,b,a]` (JSON 배열)로 변경. 표준 JSON 포맷 준수.
- **`onInspectorToggle` Disposable 미등록** (`src/extension.ts`): 반환된 `vscode.Disposable`을 `context.subscriptions`에 추가하지 않아 패널 소멸 시 콜백이 정리되지 않던 문제 수정.
- **Inspector 상태 미복원** (`src/previewManager.ts`, `media/preview.html`): 패널 재생성 후 Inspector on/off 상태가 초기화되던 버그 수정. Webview 로딩 완료 시 `webviewReady` 메시지를 전송하고 저장된 상태를 복원.

---

## [0.11.0] - 2026-04-01 — Phase 3-1: @preview-config locale/fontScale/font 파라미터 지원 (DAL-15)

### Added

- **`@preview-config` locale 파라미터** (`src/codeExtractor.ts`, `src/buildRunner.ts`, `server/preview_server.cpp`): `locale=ko_KR` 형식 파싱. Phase 1 harness 실행 시 `LANG=ko_KR.UTF-8` 환경변수, Phase 2 서버 모드에서 `setenv("LANG", ...)` 적용.
- **`@preview-config` fontScale 파라미터** (`src/codeExtractor.ts`, `src/buildRunner.ts`): `fontScale=1.5` 형식 파싱. 유효 범위 0.5~2.0 강제. 하네스 실행 시 `DALI_FONT_SCALE` 환경변수 전달.
- **`@preview-config` font 파라미터** (`src/codeExtractor.ts`, `src/buildRunner.ts`, `server/preview_server.cpp`): `font=NotoSansKR.ttf` 형식 파싱. `FontClient::Get().AddCustomFontDirectory()` 호출 코드 삽입 (Phase 1: 하네스 템플릿, Phase 2: dlopen 전 DoReload에서 적용).
- **`PreviewConfig` 인터페이스 확장** (`src/previewConfig.ts`): `locale?: string`, `fontScale?: number`, `font?: string` 필드 추가.
- **IPC RELOAD 프로토콜 확장** (`src/previewServer.ts`, `server/preview_server.cpp`): 11-필드 포맷 `RELOAD so png meta w h theme bgColor locale fontScale font`. 빈 필드는 `-` placeholder (하위 호환).
- **`{{FONT_SETUP}}` 플레이스홀더** (`server/preview_harness.cpp.template`): font 파라미터 지정 시 `AddCustomFontDirectory()` 코드 삽입, 미지정 시 빈 문자열 치환.
- **테스트 샘플** (`test/samples/multi-config-locale.preview.dali.cpp`): locale/fontScale/font 파라미터 조합 샘플 추가.

### Fixed (QA 리뷰)

- **FontClient 헤더 누락** (`server/preview_harness.cpp.template`): `{{FONT_SETUP}}` 치환 시 필요한 `#include <dali/devel-api/adaptor-framework/font-client.h>` 추가. 미추가 시 font 파라미터 지정 시 컴파일 오류 발생.
- **FontClient 호출 타이밍 오류** (`server/preview_harness.cpp.template`): `{{FONT_SETUP}}` 위치를 `main()` 상단(Application 초기화 전)에서 `OnInit()` 내부(Adaptor 초기화 후)로 이동. DALi FontClient singleton은 Adaptor 초기화 후에만 유효.
- **DALI_FONT_SCALE setenv 누락** (`server/preview_server.cpp`): Phase 2 서버 모드(dlopen) `DoReload()`에서 `fontScale` 필드를 파싱했으나 `setenv("DALI_FONT_SCALE", ...)` 호출이 빠져 있던 버그 수정. Phase 1 harness와 동작 일관성 확보.
- **IPC font 필드 프로토콜 불일치** (`src/extension.ts`, `server/preview_server.cpp`): 서버 모드에서 `font` 파일명 그대로 전송 → `rfind('/')` 시 `"."` 폴백으로 `AddCustomFontDirectory(".")` 호출되던 문제 수정. TypeScript 측(`runMultiPreview`)에서 `daliPreview.fontDirectories` 설정을 조회해 폰트 파일이 존재하는 절대 경로를 IPC에 전달하도록 변경. C++ 서버는 해당 경로를 바로 `AddCustomFontDirectory()`에 사용.
- **fontDir C++ 문자열 리터럴 인젝션** (`src/buildRunner.ts`): `fontDir`을 `FontClient::Get().AddCustomFontDirectory("${fontDir}")` 로 삽입할 때 `"` 및 `\` 미이스케이프 문제 수정. `fontDir.replace(/\\/g, '\\\\').replace(/"/g, '\\"')` 처리 추가.
- **locale 정규식 숫자/하이픈 불허** (`src/codeExtractor.ts`): `[a-zA-Z_]+` → `[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_\-]+`로 확장. BCP 47 하이픈 형식(`zh-Hans`) 및 숫자 포함 locale 지원.
- **IPC locale/font 공백 인젝션 방어** (`src/previewServer.ts`): 기존 whitespace guard가 soPath/pngPath/metadataPath만 검사했으나 locale/font 필드도 포함하도록 확장.

### Tests (QA 리뷰 추가)

- **파서 단위 테스트 8건 추가** (`test/unit/codeExtractor.test.ts`): locale 파싱, fontScale 범위 내 파싱, fontScale 범위 초과(0.1/3.0) 무시, font 파싱, fontScale+font 동시 파싱, 전체 파라미터 조합, 기존 파라미터 하위 호환 검증.
- **fontScale 경계값 테스트 4건 추가** (`test/unit/codeExtractor.test.ts`): 하한 경계(0.5) 허용, 상한 경계(2.0) 허용, 하한 직하(0.49) 거부, 상한 직상(2.01) 거부.
- **buildRunner fontSetup 테스트 3건 추가** (`test/unit/buildRunner.test.ts`): font 파일 발견 시 `AddCustomFontDirectory()` 삽입 검증, font 미지정 시 snippet 없음 검증, fontDir 내 `"` 이스케이프 처리 검증.
- **IPC 테스트 3건 업데이트 + 3건 추가** (`test/unit/previewServer.test.ts`): 11-필드 포맷 검증, bgColor placeholder 동작 검증, locale/fontScale/font 위치 검증, omit 시 `-` placeholder 검증.
- **preview_server.cpp 구조 테스트 3건 추가** (`test/unit/previewServer.test.ts`): setenv LANG, setenv DALI_FONT_SCALE, AddCustomFontDirectory 코드 존재 검증.
- **harness 템플릿 테스트 업데이트** (`test/unit/harnessGeneration.test.ts`): `{{FONT_SETUP}}` placeholder 존재 및 치환 검증. golden 파일 업데이트.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-04-01 — 버그 수정: 컬러 팔레트 배경색 렌더링 파이프라인 연결 (DAL-13)

- **색상 변경 시 리빌드 미트리거** (`src/extension.ts`): `onBackgroundChange` 콜백에서 색상 저장 후 300ms 디바운스 후 `runPreview()` 호출. 컬러 피커 드래그 시 과다 빌드(g++ 과부하) 방지. Ctrl+S 없이도 팔레트 선택 후 즉시 렌더링 반영.
- **테마 전환 시 커스텀 색상 잔류** (`src/extension.ts`): 다크↔라이트 테마 전환 시 `currentBgColor` 초기화 추가. 커맨드 팔레트 토글과 웹뷰 토글 버튼 모두 처리.
- **`hexToVector4()` 유효하지 않은 입력 시 NaN 주입** (`src/buildRunner.ts`): `#RRGGBB` 형식이 아닌 입력(빈 문자열, 접두사 없음, 길이 오류, 비16진 문자)에 대해 다크 테마 폴백 반환. 잘못된 입력이 C++ 하네스에 `NaN` 리터럴로 삽입되어 컴파일 오류를 유발하던 문제 차단.
- **`HexToColor()` 비정상 입력 시 서버 프로세스 크래시** (`server/preview_server.cpp`): `stoul()` 호출을 `try/catch(...)` 블록으로 감싸 유효하지 않은 16진 문자(예: `#GG0000`)로 인한 `std::invalid_argument` 예외가 Preview Server 프로세스를 종료하던 문제 수정. 파싱 실패 시 다크 테마 폴백 색상 반환.

### Added

- **`BuildRunner.hexToVector4()`** (`src/buildRunner.ts`): `#RRGGBB` 16진 색상 → DALi `Vector4` 리터럴 변환 static 메서드 추가.
- **`HexToColor()`** (`server/preview_server.cpp`): C++ 서버에서 `#RRGGBB` 문자열을 `Vector4`로 변환하는 static 헬퍼 추가.
- **RELOAD 프로토콜 옵셔널 색상 필드** (`src/previewServer.ts`, `server/preview_server.cpp`): `RELOAD` IPC 명령에 8번째 옵셔널 `#RRGGBB` 필드 추가. 미전송 시 기존 테마 색상 폴백 유지 (하위 호환).

### Tests

- **`BuildRunner.hexToVector4()` 단위 테스트 11건** (`test/unit/buildRunner.test.ts`): 유효한 색상(red/black/white/uppercase/mid-range) 5건 + 유효하지 않은 입력(빈 문자열, 접두사 없음, 너무 짧음, 너무 긺, 비16진 문자) 6건 — 폴백 동작 검증 포함.
- **`PreviewServer.reload()` bgColor 파라미터 테스트 3건** (`test/unit/previewServer.test.ts`): 유효한 bgColor 포함 시 RELOAD 명령에 색상 필드 추가 확인, 유효하지 않은 hex 및 undefined 시 필드 생략 확인.
- **`preview_server.cpp` HexToColor 구조 테스트 3건** (`test/unit/previewServer.test.ts`): `HexToColor` 함수 존재, bgColor 토큰 파싱, stoul try/catch 존재 검증.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-03-31 — Phase 2-4 UX: 다크/라이트 모드 전환 발견가능성 개선

### Added

- **테마 전환 상태 바 버튼** (`src/statusBar.ts`): `ThemeStatusBarItem` 클래스 추가. 상태 바 오른쪽 Secondary zone에 `$(moon)` / `$(sun)` 아이콘으로 현재 테마 표시. 클릭 시 즉시 라이트 ↔ 다크 전환. 현재 테마 상태 툴팁으로 표시.
- **커맨드 팔레트 명령** (`package.json`, `src/extension.ts`): `DALi Preview: Toggle Theme` 명령 등록. 커맨드 팔레트에서 "DALi Preview: Toggle Theme"으로 접근 가능.

### Changed

- **테마 상태 바 동기화** (`src/extension.ts`): 웹뷰 내 테마 버튼 클릭과 커맨드 팔레트 명령 모두 `themeStatusBar`를 동기화하여 일관된 상태 표시.
- **`package.json` 버전**: `0.8.0` → `0.9.0`.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-31 — Phase 2-2 UX: 실시간 프리뷰 사용성 개선

### Added

- **마지막 성공 이미지 유지** (`media/preview.html`): 빌드 에러 발생 시 이전 성공 스크린샷을 지우지 않고 이미지 위에 상단 배너만 표시.
- **에러 배너 CSS** (`media/preview.html`): `.overlay-error`를 전체 커버에서 상단 고정 배너로 변경. 불투명 빨간 배경(`rgba(200,30,30,0.95)`), `max-height: 40%`, 스크롤 가능.

- **`clearError()` 메서드** (`src/previewManager.ts`): Extension에서 Webview로 `clearError` 명령을 전달하는 메서드 추가.
- **에러 표시 500ms debounce** (`src/extension.ts`): `scheduleShowError()` / `cancelErrorDebounce()` 헬퍼 함수 추가. 빌드 실패 후 500ms 이상 지속될 때만 에러 배너 표시하여 타이핑 중 깜빡임 방지.
- **포커스 보호** (`src/previewManager.ts`, `src/extension.ts`): `show(preserveFocus = false)` 파라미터 추가. 자동 트리거(save, text change, file open)에서 `show(true)` 호출로 에디터 포커스 이탈 방지. 사용자가 명시적으로 `DALi: Open Preview` 커맨드를 실행할 때만 포커스 이동.

### Changed

- `PreviewManager.show()` 시그니처: `show()` → `show(preserveFocus = false)`. `panel.reveal()` 및 `createWebviewPanel`에 `preserveFocus` 전달.
- 빌드 성공 시 `cancelErrorDebounce()` 호출로 대기 중인 에러 타이머 취소 + 에러 배너 즉시 제거.

- **`currentTheme` 상태 + `workspaceState` 저장** (`src/extension.ts`): 마지막 선택 테마를 `daliPreview.theme` 키로 VS Code workspaceState에 자동 저장/복원.
- **빌드 파이프라인 theme 연결** (`src/extension.ts`): 단일 프리뷰와 멀티 프리뷰 모두 `currentTheme`을 buildAndRun/previewServer.reload에 전달. 멀티 프리뷰 시 `config.theme`이 설정되면 우선 적용.
- **`{{BACKGROUND_COLOR}}` 템플릿 플레이스홀더** (`server/preview_harness.cpp.template`): 하드코딩된 배경색을 치환 가능한 플레이스홀더로 교체.
- **`BuildRunner.themeToBackgroundColor()`** (`src/buildRunner.ts`): 테마 문자열을 DALi `Vector4` 색상 리터럴로 변환하는 정적 헬퍼. `buildAndRun()`에 `theme` 파라미터 추가.
- **서버 모드 theme 지원** (`server/preview_server.cpp`, `src/previewServer.ts`): RELOAD IPC 프로토콜에 옵셔널 7번째 인자 `theme`(`dark`|`light`) 추가. `ThemeToColor()` 정적 함수로 배경색 전환.
- **신규 단위 테스트 4개**:

- `src/previewServer.ts`: `reload()` 시그니처에 `theme: 'light' | 'dark' = 'dark'` 파라미터 추가.
- `server/preview_harness.cpp.template`: 배경색 `Vector4(0.1f, 0.1f, 0.12f, 1.0f)` → `{{BACKGROUND_COLOR}}` 치환.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-31 — Phase 2-3: 멀티 프리뷰 (여러 해상도/테마 동시 표시)

### Added

- **`@preview-config` 주석 파싱** (`src/codeExtractor.ts`): `@dali-preview-begin` 블록 또는 `.preview.dali.cpp` 파일 상단에 `// @preview-config: name="...", width=N, height=N, theme=light|dark` 주석을 선언하면 여러 설정을 동시에 프리뷰할 수 있음.
- **`PreviewConfig` / `MultiPreviewResult` 타입** (`src/previewConfig.ts`): 멀티 프리뷰 설정 및 빌드 결과를 담는 공유 인터페이스 파일.
- **config별 독립 `.so` 생성** (`src/buildRunner.ts`): `compilePlugin(userCode, configName?)` — configName 제공 시 `preview_plugin_{sanitized_name}.so`로 명명. 정적 메서드 `sanitizeConfigName()` 추가.
- **`updateMultiImage(results)` 메서드** (`src/previewManager.ts`): `MultiPreviewResult[]`를 받아 webview에 `updateMultiImage` 메시지 전송. 각 결과에서 PNG URI와 metadata JSON을 로드하여 포함.
- **그리드 레이아웃** (`media/preview.html`): `updateMultiImage` 메시지 수신 시 auto-fit 그리드로 여러 PNG를 동시에 표시. config 이름·해상도 라벨 및 실패 시 에러 메시지 표시. 각 프리뷰 아이템에 click-to-code 오버레이 독립 적용.
- **멀티 config 오케스트레이션** (`src/extension.ts`): `extraction.configs`가 있으면 `runMultiPreview()` 경로로 분기. configs가 없으면 기존 단일 프리뷰 동작 유지 (하위 호환). Phase 2 서버 모드와 Phase 1 폴백 모두 지원.
- **신규 단위 테스트 22개**:
  - `codeExtractor.test.ts`: `@preview-config` 단일/복수 파싱, name/width/height/theme 추출, 코드 제외, 하위 호환, `.preview.dali.cpp` 파싱, malformed 무시, optional 필드 등 7개.
  - `buildRunner.test.ts`: config별 `.so` 파일명, 기본 파일명, `sanitizeConfigName()` 동작 5종 (소문자, 공백, 특수문자, 연속 구분자, 앞뒤 제거) 등 7개.
- **샘플 파일** (`test/samples/`): `multi-config.preview.dali.cpp`, `multi-config-marker.cpp` 추가.

### Changed

- `src/codeExtractor.ts`: `ExtractionResult`에 `configs?: PreviewConfig[]` 필드 추가 (optional, 하위 호환).
- `media/preview.html`: 단일 이미지 업데이트 시 그리드 영역을 숨기고 previewArea를 표시하도록 보강.

- **빌드 generation 카운터** (`extension.ts`): 진행 중인 빌드보다 최신 요청이 있을 때 오래된 결과를 자동 폐기(soft cancel).
- **pending rebuild 큐** (`extension.ts`): 빌드 진행 중 새 트리거 수신 시 최신 doc을 큐에 저장해 빌드 완료 후 즉시 재실행.
- **새 VS Code 설정 항목**:
  - `daliPreview.livePreview` (boolean, 기본 `true`): 실시간 프리뷰 on/off 토글.
  - `daliPreview.livePreviewDebounce` (number, 기본 `300`, 100–5000): debounce 간격(ms) 설정.

- `extension.ts`: `deactivate()` 시 `liveDebouncer?.dispose()` 호출 추가.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-31 — Phase 2-1: dlopen 상주 서버

### Added

- **dlopen 상주 서버** (`server/preview_server.cpp`): DALi Application을 1회 초기화 후 stdin RELOAD 명령을 폴링하는 C++ 바이너리. 매 프리뷰마다 전체 하네스를 재컴파일/재실행하지 않아 갱신 속도가 대폭 향상됨.
- **플러그인 템플릿** (`server/preview_plugin.cpp.template`): 유저 코드만 `.so`로 컴파일하는 경량 템플릿. `extern "C" CreatePreview()` 심볼 export.
- **서버 빌드 스크립트** (`server/build_server.sh`): 서버 바이너리를 1회 컴파일하는 셸 스크립트. `-ldl` 링킹 포함.

- **`BuildRunner.compilePlugin()`** (`src/buildRunner.ts`): 유저 코드를 `-shared -fPIC`으로 컴파일해 `.so`를 생성하는 메서드.
- **`getPluginCodeOffset()`** (`src/errorParser.ts`): 플러그인 템플릿에서 `{{USER_CODE}}` 위치를 반환. 에러 라인 오프셋 매핑에 사용.
- **`StatusBarManager.showMode()`** (`src/statusBar.ts`): 서버 모드(⚡) / 컴파일 모드(🔨) 표시.
- **`test/unit/buildRunner.test.ts`**: `compilePlugin()` 단위 테스트 3개 신규 추가 (prefix 미탐지 시 실패, 템플릿 치환 검증, 컴파일 에러 반환).
- **`test/unit/statusBar.test.ts`**: `StatusBarManager.showMode()` 단위 테스트 2개 신규 추가.
- **PreviewServer IPC 행동 테스트** (`test/unit/previewServer.test.ts`): `_spawn` 주입 방식으로 8개 신규 — READY/OK:/ERROR: IPC 프로토콜, concurrent reload 방어, 서버 크래시 처리, MAX_RESTARTS 한계, READY_TIMEOUT, 경로 유효성 검사.

### Changed

- `extension.ts`: `runPreview()` 함수가 서버 가용 시 dlopen 경로를, 불가 시 기존 Phase 1 경로를 자동 선택.
- `errorParser.parseGccErrors()`: `isPlugin` 파라미터 추가 — `preview_plugin` 또는 `preview_harness` 파일 에러를 선택적으로 파싱.

### Fixed (QA 리뷰 C1–C8, H1–H6, M4–M5 반영)

- **C1** `server/preview_server.cpp`: `stof()` 호출을 try/catch로 감싸 malformed RELOAD 시 서버 크래시 방지.
- **C2** `server/preview_server.cpp`: `substr(7)` 전 `line.size() >= 6` 경계 검사 추가.

- **C4** `server/preview_server.cpp`: `dlerror()` 이중 호출 제거 — 첫 번째 호출 결과를 로컬 변수에 저장.
- **C5** `src/previewServer.ts`: `execSync()` → `util.promisify(exec)` + `await` — VS Code UI 스레드 블로킹(최대 60초) 제거.
- **C6** `src/previewServer.ts`: `PreviewServer` TypeScript 클래스 IPC 행동 테스트 신규 추가.
- **C7** `src/buildRunner.ts`: `compilePlugin()` 신규 메서드 단위 테스트 신규 추가.
- **C8** `src/statusBar.ts`: `StatusBarManager.showMode()` 단위 테스트 신규 추가.
- **H1** `src/previewServer.ts`: 동시 `reload()` 방어 — 기존 pending request를 에러로 먼저 resolve 후 새 요청 등록.
- **H2** `src/previewServer.ts`: RELOAD 경로 공백/개행 검사 추가 — IPC 커맨드 주입 방지.
- **H3** `src/previewServer.ts`: 재시작 타이머 핸들 `restartTimer` 저장 + `stop()`에서 `clearTimeout` — ghost process 방지.
- **H4** `src/previewServer.ts`: 프로세스 "error" 이벤트 핸들러에 `clearTimeout(readyTimer)` 추가.
- **H5** `src/previewServer.ts`: `pendingResolve` → `pendingRequest: { resolve, metadataPath }` — `.png` 치환 취약성 제거.
- **H6** `src/extension.ts`: `initPreviewServer()` unhandled rejection에 `.catch()` 추가.
- **M4** `src/previewServer.ts`: 재시작 `spawnServer()` 호출에 `.catch(() => {})` 추가.
